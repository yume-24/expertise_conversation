Her eyes have the same shark like quality most of ours do and the way her face looks during the interview when she's listening to the question reminds me of when i was a kid trying to teach myself how to smile and interact like other people do so as to seem genuine. I do believe her agreeing to do the ad was intentional- she knows whatsup and believes she can get away with it without consequence- which she likely will as this is the blueprint. I do not appreciate that hasan uses ASPD as a pejorative consistently but can't actually recognize one in action.  He really is doing white apologia here. ""A level of intelligience that i don't think she has"" is an ASPD diagnosed person's greatest tool- believing she's too stupid to do prolonged cruelty means she's already won on that front. Currently, being racist and using dog whistles is both largely permissible and lucrative and she has deflected in suchb a way that she has an ""out"" later using plausible deniability, ""i was young"" etc. All this to say as someone who is ASPD hasan is clearly just being a dumbass man rn- chatter was cooking when they said ""you're just being misogynistic in a way that benefits her.""",2,1762560000

It's even more so common in regards to ww. Many racial atrocities were kinda smoothed over by claiming the people committing them were more ""ignorant"" than ""racist"". 

It may seem like a passive statement to say Sweeney is too stupid to be racist on purpose but it too closely resembles those times in history. So even when Hasan acknowledges that it was racist, by calling it more stupid than racist, he is unintentionally performing  a type of historical dog-whistle signaling that the individual is ""innocent"" and shouldn't have to be accountable for their actions. 

Even today, as a black person, the whole ""they didn't do it on purpose"" is still a dog whistle  to ""let it go"" or else be seen as a villain making a big deal out of a ""mistake"".

One side would say that that some people of too stupid to be racist and thus we should give them more leeway, while the other side would say that they are not actually stupid and know exactly what they are doing, therefore, they should be punished. either way, both arguments still upholds the idea that ignorance deserves more forgiveness. but why should ignorance be absolved of responsibility? it should be entirely possible for someone to be simultaneously ignorant and deserving of full repercussions. In fact it is this way in many other fields such as law, where, ignorance of the law does not absolve people from responsibility and thus punishment for breaking the law. Thus, I think we should start treating racist the same way, it does not matter if you are ignorant or fully aware, being racist must be met with equal and fair judgement.

top,UgxsjSAHWMer1gfVwZV4AaABAg,,@sarahsann12,"She's actually a really intelligent person if you look into her background, and I think in regard to the jeans ad she related to it like it was just a job. A lot of people don't understand that because the work of an actor seems so elevated, but at the end of the day people working steadily, even though it can be fun/different, do approach it with some degree of typical work sensibility. And since it wasn't a concept she came up with herself, she did her job and seems to not feel inclined to take accountability for the innuendos entailed. Which are the work of the creatives or producers on the project, so why should she? That could be considered a cop out, but there are myriad actors who just show up to do the work that's asked of them, and don't have any inspiration to take ownership of the content, or any desire to have it be representative of who they are as a person. She can't help how others will receive the ad, or even how others will perceive her. And it's actually healthy to disassociate from being affected by either of those things as an actor. It's not out of the question to give her grace if that is her position, because at the end of the day, although highly personal in practice because it is literally her body and seeming personhood on display, it's really not a representation of her or her beliefs. And based on her response, it seems like she has a health way of approaching her work, so that she can leave it on the set/location when things are wrapped. And while maybe aware of the controversy, she doesn't feel inclined to offer commentary/explanation/converse about it, because all she did was show up and do her job. In the moment she had to understand the concept and agree to lend her presence to showcasing that, but not really something to be faulted for. All she was, was the messenger, a utility for the company. She signed a contract to be that, and fulfilled her end of the bargain effectively.
