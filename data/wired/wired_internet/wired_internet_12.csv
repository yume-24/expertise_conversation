11,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Hi, it's really, really nice to meet you.",""
12,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","What's your name?",""
13,"Speaker 2 (Child)","My name is Skylar.",""
14,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Skylar, we're here to talk about the internet,",""
15,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","and I bet you must use the internet a lot, right?",""
16,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
17,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","What's your conception about what the internet is?",""
18,"Speaker 2 (Child)","The internet? For me, it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or watch videos.",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The internet is, physically, these computers",""
20,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","that all talk to each other.",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Billions of computers, in the case of the internet.",""
22,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The internet allows us to do",""
23,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","a lot of really, really interesting,",""
24,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","what we call applications.",""
25,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You ever think about how that video gets to you",""
26,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","over the internet?",""
27,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah, I have no idea.",""
28,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Got a favorite movie?",""
29,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Matilda.",""
30,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Matilda. All right.",""
31,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We're gonna actually build an internet.",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you,",""
33,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","or a couple of toys, actually.",""
34,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers.",""
35,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And the internet is something that connects them.",""
36,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And right now, the internet is just one communication link.",""
37,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer",""
38,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","to your computer.",""
39,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So the internet is a network for carrying information",""
40,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","from one computer to another.",""
41,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it?",""
42,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Right? It's just one thing.",""
43,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Should we add some more friends in?",""
44,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
45,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here.",""
46,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","How do you think that video would sort of travel through this network?",""
47,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.",""
48,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's right.",""
49,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So that's pretty cool.",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","There are actually lots of different ways to actually go",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","through the internet to get from what we call a source,",""
52,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","the place that's sending the information,",""
53,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering the information together.",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And that's something we actually call routing.",""
55,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier for it to go from here to here, instead of going from here to here, to here to here?",""
56,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Yeah. So that's a really good observation.",""
57,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","In most pieces of the internet, that's exactly what would happen.",""
58,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We want to take what's called a shortest path.",""
59,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","But still, there are multiple paths.",""
60,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And why do you think that might be valuable?",""
61,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Maybe one way is messed up or broken. So you go the other way.",""
62,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Exactly.",""
63,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So, Skylar, that was a great discussion about what we just built.",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And I wanted to talk to you about, or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks.",""
65,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And it's not so much the thing itself, the physical thing,",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","but more about the rules about communication.",""
67,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's governed by something that are called protocols.",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Are you up for one?",""
69,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
70,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Knock, knock.",""
71,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Who's there?",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Lettuce.",""
73,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Lettuce who?",""
74,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Lettuce go on.",""
75,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right?",""
76,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The computer that you are using, say, makes a request, you ask for something, you get something in return.",""
77,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","In the internet, there are protocols everywhere.",""
78,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other.",""
79,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","This global internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other.",""
80,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","But also, what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications, Zoom, video playing services, can all run on top of the same internet.",""
81,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah, so there's one internet for all of 'em.",""
82,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Exactly.",""
83,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","There's one internet and lots and lots and lots of things that you can do on top of it.",""
