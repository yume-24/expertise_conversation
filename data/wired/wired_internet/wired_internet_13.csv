84,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So you're a student in high school, is that right?",""
85,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Yes, I'm a sophomore.",""
86,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today, and we're gonna be talking about the internet.",""
87,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I always like to think of the internet by analogy to say road systems for example, where you have roads in your neighborhood.",""
88,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You have state roads, you have the Interstate Highway System.",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And so the internet is a lot like that.",""
90,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's an interconnection of local roads, local networks like the network in your house for example.",""
91,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","How does like all of the networks in my house connect to all the city networks?",""
92,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Wow. Great question.",""
93,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable.",""
94,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second.",""
95,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's pretty fast, right?",""
96,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment, sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first network and then that network connects to another network connects to another network connects to another network.",""
97,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia. You can talk to them at the same time, and like you're reaching the same signals. So how is it that it gets there so fast?",""
98,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We could talk about that by analogy to a road system.",""
99,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's not just one big, super highway.",""
100,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected.",""
101,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And those interchanges are what are called routers.",""
102,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's where the links come together.",""
103,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia.",""
104,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast of the United States to this router, and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco, it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan.",""
105,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","So there is an underseas cable?",""
106,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The underseas cables are so cool!",""
107,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","They're these big cables that are laid down by switches.",""
108,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean.",""
109,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe, United States, Asia are all connected together.",""
110,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","How do you connect wirelessly?",""
111,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's really what we call the first hop.",""
112,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's like from your phone, from your tablet, from the computer that you're on, there's no cables coming in.",""
113,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You go over a wireless connection.",""
114,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.",""
115,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","And I was wondering how there's so many different movies or TV shows that you can download and they're all there. And if you just play it, it just knows what to play. Like they're all in one spot.",""
116,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Ah, you said they're all in one spot.",""
117,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix.",""
118,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you.",""
119,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory, a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies, and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home.",""
120,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house, how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up?",""
121,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Ah, another great question.",""
122,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","There's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet.",""
123,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your display device.",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And literally, each packet that arrives says, This is the first packet for Jenna. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fifth. This is the fourth.",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And they're reordered for you.",""
126,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Matter of fact, your computer will say, using the TCP protocol to the server, Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again?",""
127,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And again, the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again.",""
128,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The other is the internet protocol.",""
129,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","If you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service, how you've got an address on it.",""
130,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it.",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It says, This is going to Jenna.",""
132,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's going to the what's called the Internet Protocol address of your device.",""
133,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Think of all the range of devices that are hooked up to the internet.",""
134,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's totally amazing, right?",""
135,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Every single one of them has one thing in common, and that is they speak the IP protocol, the Internet Protocol.",""
136,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That was a great question.",""
