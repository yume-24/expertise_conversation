137,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So tell me a little bit about yourself?",""
138,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I am a senior at New York University. I study computer science.",""
139,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Have you taken any courses on the internet or studied it at all?",""
140,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I've taken Applied Internet Technology. So we've talked about backend/frontend frameworks and libraries, things like that.",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Okay, so really at the application level?",""
142,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","At the application level, for sure.",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet.",""
144,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?",""
145,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I have not heard of ARPANET.",""
146,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",""
147,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Actually, it was called ARPA at the time.",""
148,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","They wanted to build this notion of a packet-switching network.",""
149,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Not a circuit switch network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination.",""
150,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So what would packet switching enable? I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.",""
151,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","There's a lot big, right?",""
152,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And so remember, this was a Department of Defense, was they wanted to have forms of of communication that were very robust, that were survivable.",""
153,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Packets could all find their own ways, be routed differently through the network.",""
154,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So if parts of the network failed, you could route around failures.",""
155,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Sounds like the reason for like a request response type of structure.",""
156,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable inside the core of the network, and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.",""
157,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And to me, the really cool thing is you put this infrastructure in place, and then all these super creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it.",""
158,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.",""
159,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.",""
160,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right?",""
161,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist.",""
162,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces.",""
163,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The API for the internet is something called a socket.",""
164,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And a socket simply says, I can communicate if I know your internet address, you know, 128.119.40.186, that number is the IP address of my server, the University of Massachusetts.",""
165,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","If you know that, you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message, and it'll pop out at my end.",""
166,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I will be remembering that.",""
167,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet, something like that.",""
168,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Okay, well I don't know about the number seven, but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that.",""
169,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's called the Domain Name System.",""
170,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The DNS's role is to translate names like [gaia.cs.umass.edu](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/), or [ibm.com](http://ibm.com/), or [facebook.com](http://facebook.com/) to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name, to that named service.",""
171,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","This whatever quantity of people is able to have some form of control?",""
172,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So that's a great question.",""
173,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Who do you think controls the internet?",""
174,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'm pretty sure the internet is fairly decentralized.",""
175,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Okay. What does that mean?",""
176,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","No one authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations.",""
177,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That's 98% true.",""
178,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And if you own a network, like you're [att.com](http://att.com/), or your [verizon.com](http://verizon.com/), you can do, within that network, you can do what you want, right?",""
179,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized, that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network.",""
180,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","The 2% where you said there's nobody in control, there's a little bit of centralized control.",""
181,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","There's an organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.",""
182,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests, names and numbers.",""
183,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","It's that little bit of centralization, central authority that you need.",""
184,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","When can we see the next tenfold increase in Wi-Fi speed?",""
185,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","In terms of tenfold speeds of increases, depending on what device you're using right now, it's available, all you need to do is upgrade.",""
186,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11.",""
187,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people.",""
188,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","How can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router?",""
189,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","100 megabits per second not enough?",""
190,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Packets dropping?",""
191,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Where do they get dropped, do you think?",""
192,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Somewhere in their travel process.",""
193,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Exactly, right.",""
194,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And maybe they're dropped in your apartment, but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server, if you're watching a video, and your home.",""
195,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","So even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your apartment.",""
196,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I see.",""
197,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I'm curious, has our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet?",""
198,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I think that I've sort of realized that the internet is a technology that's dependent upon so many other factors. Some more in our control, some less.",""
