199,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Tell us a little bit about yourself?",""
200,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I'm Caspar Lant.",""
201,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I'm a PhD student at Columbia University under Henning Schulzrinne's tutelage.",""
202,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Oh, good pronunciation.",""
203,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Thank you.",""
204,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I'm interested in networking, IoT, and sort of what kind of data science you can use with the datasets that you get from such devices.",""
205,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","One of the things that I designed before, starting my PhD with Henning, was a IoT pill dispenser, essentially, which pairs with your smartphone, which does facial detection and other computer vision controls and can basically tell who's taking some sensitive medication and make sure that they've taken it correctly.",""
206,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We have these low-power devices they're sort of at the edge.",""
207,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Is it just connecting them in across a wireless link?",""
208,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Is that the primary challenge or?",""
209,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Well, I think the primary challenge is that for sure, but then an additional challenge is keeping everything configured in the way that you expect it to be configured.",""
210,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","So for example, most IoT devices require you, when you're configuring them for you to enter some kind of captive login portal where you connect to a local network that the IoT device produces, and then you can input your Wi-Fi SSID and password.",""
211,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","But then say if you were to change the password or the name of your Wi-Fi network or you move to a new place, then suddenly, everything needs to be reconfigured.",""
212,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","'Cause that's a problem that scales linearly.",""
213,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that.",""
214,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.",""
215,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Right, exactly.",""
216,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I mean, the good thing about IoT devices is that they tend to transmit very, very small amounts of data.",""
217,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","We're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device.",""
218,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","What are the typical data rates for IoT devices?",""
219,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.",""
220,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second, lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average.",""
221,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature in your house every minute.",""
222,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","That's going to be far less than kilobytes per second on average.",""
223,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","My sense is you're spot on, that they'll produce over time, a lot of data.",""
224,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data.",""
225,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","That computation happened mostly at the edge, or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center.",""
226,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Well, my sense is right now that all that data tends to be centralized because IoT devices are usually the commercial products of companies.",""
227,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Do you think they'll share it?",""
228,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Not without some persuasion, but I agree that these data have massive, massive research value.",""
229,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices, and then taking advantage of those datasets and comparing them to, say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City.",""
230,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Figuring out, look, this street next to this school is causing visible ratings above what we mandate.",""
231,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","And so there needs to be an intervention here.",""
232,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","I think for a long time, the internet hasn't grappled with, but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks, generally is the question of mobility.",""
233,"Speaker 1 (Jim Kurose)","Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another?",""
234,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Definitely.",""
235,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I mean, we're already seeing long range networks like LoRa that can, first of all, provide access over a much larger coverage area, but then also look the same because they're set up to the same specification, regardless of where the individual gateway is.",""
