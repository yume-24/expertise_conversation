154,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),maybe a wiring diagram is not,
155,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),sufficient to understand a brain,
156,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and it would be crazy to think that that would,
157,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),be sufficient actually,
158,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),if you limit the connectum to be just the wiring diagram,[connectum = connectome]
159,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),without you know more information about,
160,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),uh myelination or gal cells or all types,[gal = glial]
161,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),of environmental features that surround,
162,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),you know the neurons and ax then then,[ax = axons]
163,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),you have an incomplete picture right,
164,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),no doubt,
165,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),sometimes when people get um they,
166,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),worry about conomics I think what,[conomics = connectomics]
167,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),they're actually worrying about is that,
168,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),it's the end of the way that we used to,
169,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),do Neuroscience,
170,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),what do you think about memory,
171,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),do you think that there's um ways,
172,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),of resolving what the the substrate of,
173,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),human memory is,
174,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),you know is it just ltp and LTD,[LTP/LTD = Long-term potentiation/depression]
175,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),I'm not sure if you had a,
176,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),connectome of a human brain uh of an,
177,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),adult human,
178,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),I would be able to read out memories from that uh U,
179,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),you don't think it's just the synaptic weights,
180,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),like a an artificial neural network gets trained,
181,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),to do particular things,
182,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),it could absolutely be,
183,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),but without knowing what the weights were before the memory was,
184,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),made,
185,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),what if you uh had a violinist,
186,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),learn a piece of Bach music and you know,
187,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),could you find those notes somewhere in,
188,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),their brain they didn't know before,
189,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),yes um you know at I'm a musician and I,
190,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),don't think it's possible,
191,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),I think that there are too many you know,
192,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),so much of it is asso Ive to what you already,[asso Ive = associative]
193,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),know,
194,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and as a musician how much of it do,
195,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),you think is in your hands versus in,
196,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),your brains uh meaning like you do have,
197,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),connections in your uh muscles from the,
198,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),nerves that are from your spinal cord uh,
199,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),what if some of the learning is there,
200,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),are you still doing em or,[em = electron microscopy]
201,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),yeah I mean we do a lot of X-ray in addition to em,
202,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and this is actually I'm not saying it's the,
203,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),only problem but it's the only problem,
204,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that needs to be solved right away is,
205,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that the data analysis right,
206,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),in fact I think we calculated that there aren't,
207,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),enough humans ever to map a mouse brain,
208,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),uh uh where where you collect every,
209,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),connection and uh uh Etc,
210,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),so the problem is to get algorithms to to trace,
211,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),to recognize things in brains the way,
212,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),humans uh uh uh uh recognize things in,
213,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),brains or map Things Trace things in in,
214,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),Brains,
215,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),it's going to cost a lot of money,
216,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),uh to imagine setting the gold standard,
217,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),for the wiring diagram even once,
218,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and that's what I'm those are the kinds of,
219,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),ethical concerns that I'm worried about,
220,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),one of the things that we're not doing,
221,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),well as a field is sort of educating and,
222,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),telling people beyond our field the,
223,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),benefits of what we could achieve,
224,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and I'm impressed that when you talk to,
225,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),people about something that seems kind,
226,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),of crazy and outlandish and perhaps they,
227,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),hadn't been talking about before,
228,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),it doesn't take them long to come to a kind,
229,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),of considerate opinion,
230,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),especially children,
231,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),I think it's kind of amazing,
232,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),I mean I do hope that more people talk,
233,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),about brains and what we use brains for,
234,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),and and the ways that we shouldn't use,
235,Speaker 6 (Russell Hanson),our brains,
236,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),so I think this field has the,
237,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),opportunity to make that more real,
