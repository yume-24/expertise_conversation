37,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),connect tone,[Mispronunciation of connectome]
38,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),connect Tome,
39,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),to be honest I have no idea,
40,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that's good,
41,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that's a great place to start,
42,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),there are cells in your brain,
43,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),those brain cells are connected by wires to each other,
44,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),electricity travels down those wires,
45,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain,
46,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and each of those brain cells makes you know a thousand connections,
47,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),something like a 100 trillion connections,
48,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),uh in one brain,
49,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),in your brain,
50,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),if could I take all of that information,
51,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and put it inside a computer,
52,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),would that computer then be you,

55,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),they won't have feelings,
56,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),and I think that's one thing that makes the human race,
57,Speaker 3 (Jabez Griggs),wrong,"[Context implies ""different""]"
58,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),I would say that that map also has your feelings in it,
59,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),because here's why,
60,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),your feelings most neur scientists think come from your brain anyway,
61,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and amazingly,
62,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared,
63,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that's just brain cells communicating with each other,
