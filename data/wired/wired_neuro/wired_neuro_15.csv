99,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),say it's a large-scale attempt to,
100,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),understand the wiring map of the brain,
101,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),essentially,
102,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),great,
103,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I think that it's,
104,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),definitely needed um,
105,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely,
106,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),important but it doesn't necessarily,
107,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),tell us everything about the function so,
108,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),there's some sort of temporal order from,
109,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),neuron to neuron and region to region,
110,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),that we may not be able to pick up,
111,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),this is where it gets really crazy,
112,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),mhm,
113,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),could we simulate that map inside a computer,
114,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and would that computer then be thinking,
115,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),like that original brain for which we made the map,
116,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I mean that's not,
117,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),that's not the person,
118,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I mean having a,
119,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),representation of someone's neural,
120,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),network is just that,
121,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),it's just a representation of their neural network,
122,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I I mean because there's more to the to you,
123,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),in here than just information passing,
124,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),between neurons,
125,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),I'd like to think so huh,
126,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),it would be like if you simulated a hurricane,
127,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),imagine we could keep track of every,
128,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),variable of a hurricane wind speed,
129,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),every water molecule etc etc temperature,
130,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and we put that inside a super fast computer,
131,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and we simulated it right,
132,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),I don't think anyone would think that the inside of,
133,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),the computer would get wet uh uh,
134,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly,
135,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that wetness is consciousness,
136,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),is what we are are,
137,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),is it ethical to imagine mapping a a male brain versus a female brain,
138,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),to look for differences,
139,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),between those to explain alleged,
140,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),behavioral differences between them,
141,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),every single person is different,
142,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),and so it should be okay to map every single,
143,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),person's brain,
144,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I mean I understand that there are,
145,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),that it's very sensitive,
146,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),you know,
147,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),wait what do you think is sensitive,
148,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),mapping an Indian brain versus a Caucasian brain,
149,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),or politically,
150,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),I think that people may have some issue with,
151,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),mapping out what causes or what makes a,
152,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),difference between huh,
153,Speaker 5 (Mala Ananth),different types of people,
