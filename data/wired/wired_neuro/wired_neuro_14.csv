64,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),other so I think today we're going to,
65,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),talk about a connectome,
66,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),do you have you ever heard of that,
67,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),a connectome,
68,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),yeah no,
69,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),I I don't think so,
70,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),it's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain,
71,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),uh um literally in a human brain,[lit Al = literally]
72,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),something like the map of the one quadrillion connections,
73,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that 100 billion neurons make with each other,
74,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),is this like a a a map where that's like an actual visual representation,
75,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),like using microscopy or just data,
76,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),wow wow I'm understanding more so that it's these these,
77,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),the a mapping of the neuro the the circuitry,
78,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain,
79,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),that are common between different people,
80,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),we have to use electron microscopes,
81,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and then we've been developing are ways to slice the brain into really thin slices,
82,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice,
83,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and then use computers to put it all back,
84,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),imagine that we could get the map of every connection right,
85,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and we knew how neurons fired,
86,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),do you think we could put that in a computer,
87,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),that map,
88,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),and then therefore that computer should be able to think,
89,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),just like like the brain that we extracted it from,
90,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),well the computer only communicates with itself in binary,
91,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),so it only has two options,
92,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),it can only ask itself yes or no questions,
93,Speaker 4 (Elena Dowling),but a human brain has an Infinity of directions that it can go,
94,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),neurons are also um uh digital,
95,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),uh meaning a neuron either fires or it doesn't fire,
96,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),so that's either one or a zero,
97,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),uh and it's the combination of those ones or zeros,
98,Speaker 1 (Dr. Bobby Kasthuri),"that actually produce the 10,000 different answers that you say",
