6,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What's your name?",""
7,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Namina.",""
8,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Our topic today is quantum sensing.",""
9,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So quantum is about the study of stuff that's really, really, really small and sensing is about measuring.",""
10,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses.",""
11,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So do you know what your five senses are?",""
12,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling.",""
13,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Mm-hmm.",""
14,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah, and touch.",""
15,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Touch, exactly.",""
16,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses, so we know what's happening in the world around us, right?",""
17,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see.",""
18,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Let me show you.",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Can you see inside it with your eyes?",""
20,"Speaker 2 (Child)","No, I don't think so.",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","No? Okay.",""
22,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Can you bounce it for me?",""
23,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Mm-hmm.",""
24,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Do you know what makes it bounce?",""
25,"Speaker 2 (Child)","I think like inside of it, it's foam that's fluffy, but my second answer is, I think it's very soft.",""
26,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","That's a great description.",""
27,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Can we cut one open and see what it looks like?",""
28,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
29,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","You think that's a good idea?",""
30,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Here's a ball that's been cut straight in half and you look inside.",""
31,"Speaker 2 (Child)","It's hard.",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It is.",""
33,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What gives it a certain texture?",""
34,"Speaker 2 (Child)","It's like, the texture of like the top of a crayon.",""
35,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Oh, but you were right that it was like foam.",""
36,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It would be really cool if we could see inside the ball without cutting it open, right.",""
37,"Speaker 2 (Child)","But you could use a magnifying glass and then look at the ball.",""
38,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","But with the magnifying glass, you'd only be able to see what's right near the surface, right?",""
39,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Just.",""
40,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
41,"Speaker 2 (Child)","You wouldn't be able to see into the middle.",""
42,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","If you had the right tools, you could start to think about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open.",""
43,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","That would then, you'd still have your ball.",""
44,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We could still play with it.",""
45,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah, yeah, it would be cool if we like used something like an x-ray, we build an x-ray",""
46,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
47,"Speaker 2 (Child)","That was only made for balls and you could see everything inside it, every single detail, you could zoom in and out",""
48,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
49,"Speaker 2 (Child)","And you could draw it, print it out.",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","That's exactly the type of thing that we're doing.",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We are sensing, is we're trying to measure what's inside, and do it without destroying the ball.",""
52,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
53,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","For example, we want to go inside, let's say the human body and see what's happening.",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Sometimes we can look under the surface of the Earth and see what's underneath it.",""
55,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We can make really, really precise clocks that will tell us, that can measure time really, really accurately.",""
56,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And we can make very, very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us.",""
57,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","But we need to build better tools that allow us to do that.",""
