58,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Our topic today is gonna be quantum sensing.",""
59,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Have you ever heard of it before?",""
60,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","No.",""
61,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","No.",""
62,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Okay, what do you think it might mean, if you just break down the words?",""
63,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Something on a very small scale because of the word quantum.",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
65,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","The sensing part, I'm not sure.",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So sensing is really just about measuring stuff.",""
67,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And at some level, there's different set of rules that seem to come into play 'cause you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things.",""
69,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","But one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale.",""
70,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity.",""
71,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So they're really, really sensitive to small changes, but they're also gonna be really reliable.",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Every time I make that measurement, I'll always get the same results.",""
73,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay, measurements on like what kinds of things?",""
74,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Could be on almost anything you want.",""
75,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Have you ever broken a bone?",""
76,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Well, I fractured something though.",""
77,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Okay, do you remember having an x-ray?",""
78,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah, x-ray and I have had a few MRIs before too.",""
79,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","You've had a few MRIs before.",""
80,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
81,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And so, both of those are in some ways a form of sensing and they rely on different types of sensing.",""
82,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Do you know what this image is?",""
83,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Maybe an MRI.",""
84,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Exactly.",""
85,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
86,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Do you know what an MRI, how an MRI works?",""
87,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","No, I don't and I feel like I should because I've gotten them millions of times.",""
88,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And what the MRI scanner is doing is, it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom.",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In our bodies, we have these hydrogen atoms that are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them.",""
90,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So in some sense, you've already used a quantum sensor.",""
91,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah, so are MRIs essentially more detailed x-rays?",""
92,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","They're not.",""
93,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So they're giving us different types of information.",""
94,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
95,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So this is an x-ray.",""
96,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","You don't see any of the soft tissue.",""
97,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","The x-ray gave us information about the bone.",""
98,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
99,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Whereas MRIs giving us information about things like the softer tissues.",""
100,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
101,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And in fact, we don't see the bone very well in the MRI.",""
102,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
103,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So there are slightly different reasons why you would choose the two different things.",""
104,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Suppose I could get a higher resolution.",""
105,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Mm-hmm.",""
106,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What do you think I would be able to see?",""
107,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","The different atoms and the structures of the particles.",""
108,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
109,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Start to see the different cells",""
110,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
111,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And then the different chemicals in the cells.",""
112,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","If you look at the MRI images, you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like.",""
113,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","But if you wanna zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor that's gonna be more sensitive and for something like that, you're gonna need a quantum sensor.",""
114,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Are there different types of quantum sensors for different things?",""
115,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So one of the quantum sensors that's related to the work that I do is based on these defects that are called nitrogen-vacancy centers",""
116,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
117,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In a diamond",""
118,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","and people actually now make nano diamonds that they can try to put inside the human body to look at the chemistry inside the cells.",""
119,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","So is that used for drug trials and when testing out new treatments?",""
120,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We can do it on tissues right now or on the surface, but we can't actually do it inside the body.",""
121,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So right now, we're struggling to figure out which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it.",""
122,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Are there any other quantum sensors at the moment that are in the developmental stage anymore that we are using?",""
123,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications, one of them is a magnetometer",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","and those can be really, really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields.",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","They are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors.",""
126,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Right now, we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground.",""
127,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","You talked about a sensor measuring magnetic fields.",""
128,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
129,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","What does that help us learn?",""
130,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","What is that good for?",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Well, if I wanna navigate, and I know what the structure of the Earth's magnetic fields are, in some ways, that's how birds navigate.",""
132,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
133,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","The avian compass.",""
134,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
135,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In fact, people think of that as a quantum sensor.",""
136,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay, so they've got like built-in.",""
137,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","A biological quantum sensor.",""
138,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
139,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","They have a built-in sensor and one of the ideas is that, they're using quantum phenomena",""
140,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","To figure out what the direction of the Earth's magnetic field is.",""
142,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","That's why they're able to be, homing pigeons are able to come back",""
144,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
145,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","To their original location.",""
146,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Oh, that's cool.",""
147,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
