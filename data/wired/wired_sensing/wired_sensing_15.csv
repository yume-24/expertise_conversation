210,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So what drew you into quantum computing?",""
211,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","I think what got me into material science was actually making semiconductors",""
212,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","For solar panels.",""
213,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Okay.",""
214,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Then, that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now is quantum computings.",""
215,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And what about you? What got you interested in quantum sensing?",""
216,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah, I started out doing magnetic resonance, studying things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance.",""
217,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me.",""
218,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects, I guess?",""
219,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","In a way, it's part of the same continuum.",""
220,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","What you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively.",""
221,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","The resolution you're able to get is much higher, so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume.",""
222,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","How is the resolution higher?",""
223,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So it's because the nitrogen-vacancy center is a single defect.",""
224,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So you can actually see a single electron.",""
225,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","In normal magnetic resonance, you don't have the sensitivity.",""
226,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In order to be sensitive to like a single electron, do you have to be really close to it?",""
227,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","You have to be close to it.",""
228,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","You can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron, we wouldn't be able to do that because there, the energy is too low compared to thermal energies.",""
229,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","But what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion in energy.",""
230,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So you can couple into an optical photon, which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect a micro wave.",""
231,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Okay, I see.",""
232,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Yeah.",""
233,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And that's why you're able to do it at room temperature as well.",""
234,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","What are some of the challenges you face when trying to do quantum sensing with this platform?",""
235,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","One of the key challenges, I think for all, any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times.",""
236,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better?",""
237,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So if I take a single qubit or a single spin, there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity.",""
238,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","But if I can take entangled spins, in principle, I could make the system much more sensitive, but it usually comes at a cost 'cause when I entangle something, it's much more sensitive to de-coherence as well.",""
239,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In a similar way, but maybe even in the opposite way where we want to figure out how to be as resilient from noise and all the kinds of noise sources.",""
240,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Exactly.",""
241,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Okay.",""
242,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What are you studying?",""
243,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","I'm studying superconducting qubits that use hybrids, semiconductor, superconductor structures.",""
244,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah, semiconductors, are you introducing new noise sources potentially that might affect the coherence times?",""
245,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Yeah, yeah, so the big one is charge noise, 'cause I guess a lot of the superconducting qubits, they have made 'em in such a way that they're insensitive to charge.",""
246,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Exactly.",""
247,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So when you think of noise, in what way is a noise bad for your system?",""
248,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","I usually think of it like, well, we work with quantum systems.",""
249,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
250,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And those are very sensitive to fluctuations.",""
251,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
252,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","I guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state.",""
253,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","I think as you said, you know, anything that interferes with my signal is noise, but it can come from different sources.",""
254,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In some ways, the operation of the quantum system itself, as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena, the ones that I don't like, I call noise.",""
255,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","The ones I do like, I call signal and that's an artificial definition that I'm making when I choose to build a sensor.",""
256,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","One of the challenges we have is, we're trying to figure out if I wanna control it, where is it coming from?",""
257,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","I remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz.",""
258,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","All of a sudden, we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local FM stations.",""
259,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And that was a source of noise, like, it's completely random, but it is still there.",""
260,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor, into your quantum system and are also producing noise.",""
261,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","But yeah, the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise intrinsically from whatever.",""
262,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Right, it could give you information if you read it out, about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about.",""
263,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about?",""
264,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So one of the things that we're interested in is looking at, suppose, I want to build an entangled quantum sensor, when I put a number of spins together, in addition to being sensitive to an external field, they're sensitive to each other",""
