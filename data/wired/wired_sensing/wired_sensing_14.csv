148,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What year are you in?",""
149,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'm a senior, I'm studying physics right now.",""
150,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Cool.",""
151,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing?",""
152,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles, like interactions and stuff, maybe.",""
153,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Yeah.",""
154,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It is exactly using quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that, if I can harness quantum phenomena and I can push the limits that are possible, I can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate over time too.",""
155,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Okay. How is it more precise?",""
156,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","We believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are, and so a quantum sensor, in that sense, would reach the limits of what's attainable.",""
157,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","It would be the top tier.",""
158,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It would be the top tier.",""
159,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","What are you doing? Like, what are you studying?",""
160,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So I study spins.",""
161,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And so, spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and I study spins on the solid state.",""
162,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And one of the platforms I work on is nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.",""
163,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Okay.",""
164,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Which is a really nice platform because the spins show their quantum properties, even at room temperature.",""
165,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So, are you studying the spins of the electrons?",""
166,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So in some sense, the phenomena we're studying essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena, but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the nuclei.",""
167,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So you mentioned the diamonds that are used to create the sensors.",""
168,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Right.",""
169,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So how long does it take to make a sensor and to make that diamond?",""
170,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Is that created?",""
171,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Do you like, put energy into it or?",""
172,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it, and then you get these nitrogen-vacancy centers in your system.",""
173,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So you mentioned quantum computing earlier.",""
174,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So have you heard of the idea of superposition?",""
175,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Mm-hmm, yeah.",""
176,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing, as well as quantum computing.",""
177,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superposition of two states.",""
178,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one.",""
179,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So switch is either on or off.",""
180,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Whereas in a quantum system, it can be in what's called a superposition.",""
181,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So it can be partially on and partially off.",""
182,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","But one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superpositions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us.",""
183,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","In quantum computing, you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property",""
184,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor",""
185,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","because now you're actually, you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say, wait, it's sensing something.",""
186,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Okay, so it's like using like, the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs?",""
187,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it, what you do is, you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say, what do you see?",""
188,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","What are you sensitive to?",""
189,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor, but it's even more fragile.",""
190,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","How does entanglement work into it?",""
191,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","So entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated.",""
192,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","They're essentially in the same quantum state, so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle.",""
193,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And so, if I have a large number of quantum sensors that are entangled, then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if I just had one of them interact at a time.",""
194,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Okay.",""
195,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","And so that gives you a boost in sensitivity when you have an entangled",""
196,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","And so, it's more precise.",""
197,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","It's more precise,",""
198,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","If you have it entangled.",""
199,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Absolutely.",""
200,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Okay.",""
201,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","Is an atomic clock a quantum sensor?",""
202,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","In some ways, it is",""
203,"Speaker 1 (Sekhar Ramanathan)","and you know, atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences.",""
