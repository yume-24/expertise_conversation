47,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What does infinity mean to you?",""
48,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Really anything that has no end to it.",""
49,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, that's absolutely right.",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics.",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","There's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number, just like the number 13, just like the number 10 million.",""
52,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the reason that mathematicians consider infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set.",""
53,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all counting numbers.",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, et cetera.",""
55,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That list goes on forever. That is an infinite set.",""
56,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And to be a little bit more precise, it's a countably infinite set.",""
57,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","But as a number, infinity is pretty strange.",""
58,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","What do you mean by that?",""
59,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Adding infinities. Multiplying infinities.",""
60,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already.",""
61,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","But it's also totally different.",""
62,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It has some very weird properties.",""
63,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Welcome to Hilbert's Hotel.",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Unlike an ordinary hotel, has countably infinitely many rooms.",""
65,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Suppose a new guest shows up, you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall, all the way at infinity, except there isn't a room like that.",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","The rooms each have a number, and even though there's infinitely many rooms, each room is only a finite distance away.",""
67,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So here's how we're gonna make room for the new guest.",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'm gonna ask the guest in room one to move into room two, and then we're gonna ask the guest in room two to move into room three, and we'll continue this all the way along.",""
69,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It looks to me like there's space for the new guest. Where is it?",""
70,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","It'll be in room number one.",""
71,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Room number one. Exactly.",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'm gonna use this symbol for infinity, but what we've just shown is that one, the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same infinity.",""
73,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What happens if we had a second guest?",""
74,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Would it be two plus infinity equals infinity?",""
75,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Absolutely.",""
76,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So now I'm gonna make this story a little more complex.",""
77,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them.",""
78,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","They can't live together?",""
79,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","They can't live together.",""
80,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That would be a great solution. I don't know.",""
81,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I think these people don't really get along.",""
82,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms, but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away.",""
83,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two.",""
84,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So that's creating one new space for us.",""
85,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And I'm gonna take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four.",""
86,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Are you starting to see a pattern here?",""
87,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Yes. You're going up one each time?",""
88,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, I'm increasing by one more each time.",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I'm doubling the room number in fact.",""
90,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity.",""
91,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we have two Hilbert Hotels, each of which have infinitely many guests, then this is equal to?",""
92,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Infinity.",""
93,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Infinity, great.",""
94,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Hilbert's Hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counterintuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity.",""
95,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","How does infinity come across in mathematics for you?",""
96,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","So when I'm teaching calculus and talking about concepts like limits and derivatives, those are only defined precisely with infinity.",""
97,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Teaching algebra, which is meant in a different sense about number systems, we deal with infinite families of numbers in their operations.",""
98,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","Infinite sets are somehow very exotic.",""
99,"Speaker 3 (Teenager)","They're not found so commonly in their real world, but they're all over mathematics.",""
