1,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'm Emily Riehl and I'm a mathematician.",""
2,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I've been challenged to explain the concept of infinity at five levels of increasing complexity.",""
3,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So while the concept of infinity can seem mysterious, and it's very difficult to find infinity in the real world, mathematicians have developed ways to reason very precisely about the strange properties of infinity.",""
4,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what do you know about infinity?",""
5,"Speaker 2 (Child)","I think it means that it's really just something that's infinite, that never ends.",""
6,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That's a great way to think about it.",""
7,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Infinity is something that never ends, where finite, the opposite of infinity, refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through, at least in theory if given enough time.",""
8,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So if you had to guess, how many Skittles are in this jar?",""
9,"Speaker 2 (Child)","I would say about like 217.",""
10,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","217.",""
11,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And if we wanted to figure out the exact number, how would we find out?",""
12,"Speaker 2 (Child)","We could put them all out and divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that.",""
13,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, absolutely.",""
14,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","In fact, I did that before you got here, and it's 649 Skittles.",""
15,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Here's a much harder question.",""
16,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","How many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar?",""
17,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Maybe like 4,012.",""
18,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'll admit. I have absolutely no idea.",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number?",""
20,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Finite because I can see them all in here.",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, you can see them all.",""
22,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And in fact, if we were really, really, really patient, we could do the same thing as with the Skittles.",""
23,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","But here's another question.",""
24,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","You said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar, and I agree.",""
25,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter?",""
26,"Speaker 2 (Child)","An infinite amount of jars.",""
27,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Very good. Why do you say that?",""
28,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Because if there's unlimited pieces of glitter, we need unlimited pieces of jar.",""
29,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So let's try and imagine infinitely many jars.",""
30,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Would they fit in this room?",""
31,"Speaker 2 (Child)","No.",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, absolutely not.",""
33,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Because this room holds only a finite amount of space.",""
34,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And in fact, infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe that astronomers can see.",""
35,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Really how does that make you feel?",""
36,"Speaker 2 (Child)","That makes me feel like my brain is exploding.",""
37,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, that makes me feel like my brain is exploding.",""
38,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Can infinity ever get bigger?",""
39,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That's a wonderful question, a very rich question.",""
40,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What do you think?",""
41,"Speaker 2 (Child)","I think maybe because you said it was unlimited.",""
42,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","You have very good intuition.",""
43,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things.",""
44,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And if you repeat those processes, it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity.",""
45,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what have you learned today about infinity?",""
46,"Speaker 2 (Child)","I've learned that even if it's unlimited, there are many different ways of making infinity and you can never actually see it all.",""
