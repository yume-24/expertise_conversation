257,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So implicitly in a lot of my research, I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe countably many inaccessible cardinals.",""
258,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Examples of infinite sets abound in mathematics.",""
259,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","You know, we see them every day.",""
260,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So do those infinities exist?",""
261,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Think you'll get a different answer from every person, every mathematician you meet.",""
262,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It is a construct.",""
263,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","So it exists in the same way that things like poetry exists when you talk about even cardinality and it's just like, well here's an infinite hotel.",""
264,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","I had one student who was like, no, no, it does not exist.",""
265,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","When I describe, well imagine you do this infinitely many times, they're done with me because they're like ""I can't, no one can do this infinitely many times"".",""
266,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","These interesting paradoxes that come from like the ape typing on a typewriter and eventually getting to Hamlet is an example of well if you give something forever and any random event is going to happen.",""
267,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It can be generative for sure.",""
268,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It's definitely a really interesting thing to try to talk to students about.",""
269,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist.",""
270,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","For me, infinite objects absolutely exist.",""
271,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And I can't read the thoughts in your head, but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about infinity.",""
272,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It's this idea that are things that you can think of, do they exist?",""
273,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","You're getting into philosophy of math now.",""
274,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It's just exciting.",""
275,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities, for instance.",""
276,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions, particularly when we're talking about certain things like infinity.",""
277,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the continuum hypothesis.",""
278,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What do you say to students about the continuum hypothesis?",""
279,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","The most fun thing to teach when you teach about infinity, when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of infinity, but then a natural thing is for them to think about what is the next size of infinity that I can think about?",""
280,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And sort of the continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp.",""
281,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what's so fascinating about the continuum hypothesis, if you take a subset of the real line that's infinite, does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of continuum, or is there some sort of third possibility?",""
282,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What's very surprising is the continuum hypothesis has been completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false.",""
283,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So this is a little bit confusing.",""
284,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","The standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the continuum hypothesis one way or the other.",""
285,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it.",""
286,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So mathematical practice is to be exact transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem.",""
287,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the modularized space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this.",""
288,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","If the foundations were to change, if set theory were replaced by something else, maybe dependent type theory, do you think the theorem you've proven would still be true?",""
289,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","There's a lot of math that we sort of take for granted as this is the thing that you can do without really admitting that we are creating the foundations that are the basis for the work we do later.",""
290,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And so yes, I think that if we change the foundations, we would change mathematics.",""
291,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","But I think that's also very humbling in that it's not that we're sort of discovering a universal truth, it's we are humans constructing meaning.",""
292,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It's abstract art in a sense.",""
293,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","There is something there even if you can't see all the pieces for particular things.",""
294,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And I think that it's really fascinating.",""
295,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","I was thinking about this on the drive here.",""
296,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","The way that I interact with infinity I mentioned earlier is sometimes we, in number theory especially, we say, ""does this type of equation have infinitely many solutions?""",""
297,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And then the question is are there infinitely many, are there not?",""
298,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Or are there infinitely many twin primes?",""
299,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","These are sort of interesting ideas but I don't think that knowing if it's infinite or not is necessarily the most interesting thing for me.",""
300,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","What's been most interesting to me is all the math that gets developed to be able to answer that question.",""
301,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Given current technology.",""
302,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And who knows what mathematics will look like in 100 years.",""
303,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","150 years ago when we barely knew infinity, and look where we are today.",""
304,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Infinity inspires me to imagine a world that is so much broader than what I'll ever experience with my senses over the span of a human life.",""
305,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","The ideas can just go on and on and on forever.",""
