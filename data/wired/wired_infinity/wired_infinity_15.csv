192,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","You're a PhD student, is that right?",""
193,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Yes, I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Maryland.",""
194,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Does infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying?",""
195,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","One place infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry.",""
196,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Normally we think okay, well if you have two lines like this, you'd keep drawing them, they intersect right here.",""
197,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","But in projective space, two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity.",""
198,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property.",""
199,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What's your research in?",""
200,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","So one of my main research areas is something called category theory, it's been described as the mathematics of mathematics.",""
201,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","It's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems.",""
202,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","And an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work.",""
203,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","When you're proving theorems, have you ever used the axiom of choice?",""
204,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Yeah, it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set.",""
205,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And a choice function does what exactly?",""
206,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Yeah, that's a good question.",""
207,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty, then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once.",""
208,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","When you've used the axiom of choice in proofs, do you know which incarnation of this you've used?",""
209,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Yeah, I've used it like that.",""
210,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I've also used it in Zorn's lemma and in the well ordering principle.",""
211,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axiom of choice.",""
212,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","The well ordering principle is the assumption, the axiom that any set can be well ordered, but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element.",""
213,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So that ordering is not a well ordering.",""
214,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So here's the key question.",""
215,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Do you believe the axiom of choice?",""
216,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I do believe the axiom of choice.",""
217,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","You do believe the axiom of choice, though it leads us to some strange conclusions.",""
218,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So if the axiom choice is true, then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the reals.",""
219,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers.",""
220,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","This is trans-finite induction.",""
221,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It would work for any ordinal.",""
222,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers.",""
223,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And this allows us to prove some crazy things.",""
224,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Imagine three-dimensional Euclidean space.",""
225,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the space that we live in, extending infinitely in all directions.",""
226,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional Euclidean space by disjoint circles, so infinitesimal circles, disjoint circles of radius one.",""
227,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are solid circles and then another circle can somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps in between.",""
228,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","It's crazy.",""
229,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It's not the only crazy thing.",""
230,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Do you have a favorite consequence of the axiom of choice?",""
231,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","I mean the Banach-Tarski paradox is a big one.",""
232,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","So basically it says that you can, using just rigid motions I think, you can take one ball--",""
233,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","One solid ball with a finite volume.",""
234,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Cut it up and then rearrange the pieces so that in the end you get two balls which are the exact same size, the exact same volume.",""
235,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","So you've actually taken one thing and using just pretty normal operations to it, you can double it, which seems pretty implausible in real life.",""
236,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Right. That seems crazy to me.",""
237,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And yet it's an irrefutable consequence of this axiom that you tell me you believe is true.",""
238,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So how many infinities are there?",""
239,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Well, definitely uncountably many infinities.",""
240,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So there's certainly no stop to this procedure.",""
241,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","But could you give a precise cardinality to that?",""
242,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","Probably not because if I could, there would be a set of all sets, right?",""
243,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So Cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set A, its power set has a strictly larger cardinality.",""
244,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And since that's true for any set, we can just iterate this process.",""
245,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","When set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century, one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets?",""
246,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","This comes up in my research in category theory because even though there is no set of all sets, we would really like for there to be a category of sets.",""
247,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory.",""
248,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","One of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander Grothendieck.",""
249,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","This is something that we sometimes call a Grothendieck universe, or also an inaccessible cardinal.",""
250,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory.",""
251,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","It's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach.",""
252,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","So you're just making a cutoff point.",""
253,"Speaker 5 (Graduate Student)","You're saying we're never gonna get sets bigger than this anyway, so we might as well make our category only include things smaller than that.",""
254,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That's right.",""
255,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality, Alpha say.",""
256,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger Grothendieck universe Beta.",""
