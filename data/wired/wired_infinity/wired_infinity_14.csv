100,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What do you know about infinity?",""
101,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","A property of something being endless.",""
102,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Great.",""
103,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So today we're gonna focus on infinity as a cardinality, and what cardinality means is it's a size of a set.",""
104,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What are you studying?",""
105,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'm studying computer science",""
106,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Studying computer science.",""
107,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Are you taking any math courses right now?",""
108,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Yeah, right now I'm taking calculus two.",""
109,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Calculus involves the study of functions.",""
110,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics, but they aren't always so clearly defined.",""
111,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What would you say a function is?",""
112,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output.",""
113,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That's the computer science brain thinking right there.",""
114,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we wanna think of a function as procedure or mapping between sets.",""
115,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set.",""
116,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","We call such functions bijections or isomorphisms.",""
117,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set, no matter how many elements there are, these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about infinity.",""
118,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","How can you compare something that is endless?",""
119,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Today we're gonna think about infinity as a cardinality, which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a set.",""
120,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And we're gonna use this idea of one-to-one correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size.",""
121,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics.",""
122,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set.",""
123,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers.",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Both of these are infinite sets.",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Are they the same size infinity or different size infinities?",""
126,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Yes, the integers would, there'd be more integers than natural numbers.",""
127,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","I'm gonna now try and convince you that they are in fact the same size infinity.",""
128,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor.",""
129,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over, so that there's a bijective function between them, then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers.",""
130,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Start by matching zero with zero and one with one.",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","But then we wanna include the negatives in the list.",""
132,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So which natural number would we match with negative one?",""
133,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Maybe two.",""
134,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Maybe two. Why not?",""
135,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives.",""
136,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","We can match the natural number three with the integer two, the natural number four with the integer minus two.",""
137,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And do you see a pattern?",""
138,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","All of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all of the negative integers would be even numbers?",""
139,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Great.",""
140,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So now I have a much harder question.",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we have the same challenge, again, evidently there are way, way, way more rational numbers than there are integers.",""
142,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Does that mean this is a larger infinite set than the integers?",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What do you think?",""
144,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","By intuition I would say yes, but that was the same case with the integers.",""
145,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers.",""
146,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically.",""
147,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice.",""
148,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So Z cross Z refers to the set of all of these dots.",""
149,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I'll start by counting the number at the origin, and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin, moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away.",""
150,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Oh is it for each rational number, there's a pair of integers that represent that rational number?",""
151,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yeah, that's exactly right.",""
152,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And now for each pair of integers, I'm gonna represent it by a corresponding natural number.",""
153,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","That's what's going on with this counting.",""
154,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And when I compose those operations, what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger, there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers.",""
155,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So this slope is represented by three, two, and three, two is in here as 25.",""
156,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Exactly. That's exactly right.",""
157,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we were hoping to compare the size of infinity of the rational numbers with the size of infinity of the natural numbers.",""
158,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What we've done is introduced an intermediate set, these pair of integer points, and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity.",""
159,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Since we also have an injective function the other way, this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size.",""
160,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","That's wild.",""
161,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed, which are the real numbers, all of the points on the number line.",""
162,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Do you think that's the same size infinity?",""
163,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I guess again, intuition seems like it must be much larger, but I don't know, I haven't been on a roll.",""
164,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Georg Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers.",""
165,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","This is called the cardinality of the continuum, it is uncountable.",""
166,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list.",""
167,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Okay, so here's how we do this.",""
168,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look at the diagonal elements.",""
169,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I'll highlight them.",""
170,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","This continues forever, and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these.",""
171,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","If you just like added one to them, then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones.",""
172,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Yes. You see the idea right away.",""
173,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So I'm gonna form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one.",""
174,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere.",""
175,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Why is that?",""
176,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Because at every point there's at least one change from a number in there.",""
177,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Great. That's exactly right.",""
178,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So what we've proven is that this number is missing, and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.",""
179,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Oh wow.",""
180,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we've started to explore some of the counterintuitive properties of infinity.",""
181,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","On the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality.",""
182,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","While there are other infinities that are larger.",""
183,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So there's more than one size of infinity, not all infinities are created equal.",""
184,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are, what you can do with this sort of knowledge.",""
185,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Really glad you asked me that.",""
186,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","There's a practical implication for computer science.",""
187,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","Alan Turing, he came up with a mathematical model of a computer, something called a Turing machine.",""
188,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So Turing was wondering is it possible to compute every real number, an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary precision in finite time?",""
189,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","He defined a real number to be computable if you could calculate its value, maybe not exactly, but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time.",""
190,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","And because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, but only a countably infinitely many Turing machines, what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable.",""
191,"Speaker 1 (Emily Riehl)","So we'll never be able to access them with a computer program.",""
