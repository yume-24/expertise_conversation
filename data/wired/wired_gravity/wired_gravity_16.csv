259,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force,"
260,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","to the Earth creating curves in spacetime, then we moved on to just diffuse seas of energy and spacetime as"
261,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about spacetime in general. And here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics."
262,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?"
263,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Well, one thing is quantum mechanics."
264,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Mhm."
265,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science."
266,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","It explains the most different phenomena the most precisely."
267,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it."
268,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges."
269,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And in the Fineman way, the way that Fineman taught us, you know they come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again."
270,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So that's how we think of an electron and light scattering for instance."
271,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And the language that Einstein gave us is so different. It's completely geometric. It's all of this spacetime."
272,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And it's also unnecessary."
273,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Yeah, for me the the beauty of the theory of gravity is is the way Einstein formulated it as a theory of geometry."
274,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Of curved space and time."
275,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","I think like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it."
276,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Is there really spacetime or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"
277,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Well, I think there is really spacetime in the sense that it it's a description that works really well. So there has to be something right about it."
278,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","But if we're going to talk about what's really, really underlying that, and we're going to put quantum mechanics into the mix,"
279,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","then there should be some quantum mechanical wave function for spacetime."
280,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","You should be able to take two different spacetimes and add them together 'cause one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics as you know is take any wave together. Yeah, any two states, any two possible states of the world."
281,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","You can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a that's a sensible state. That's a good state that makes sense."
282,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So do you think that there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual spacetimes, but we should be thinking about superpositions of spacetimes?"
283,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Yeah, I think so. I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that. I mean, if we believe the the dominant standard model of cosmology,"
284,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seated all the galaxies and stars and us, everything else in the world."
285,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","So there's a galaxy over there, let's say and not over there."
286,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Mhm. So how did that happen? Why is there a galaxy there and not there?"
287,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","In the standard theory as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event. Yeah. And that doesn't mean that it happened there and not there 'cause you flipped the coin. It actually happened in both places."
288,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","There's got to be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there and in the other branch it's the opposite."
289,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately."
290,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And we're talking about how our theory of gravitation, which we now think of as a theory of spacetime, has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things and we don't have that yet."
291,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few, right? It's the Big Bang because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action."
292,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And there's black holes."
293,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Sure, yeah. It's it is a beautiful, beautiful idea."
294,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","One of the most interesting discoveries, of course, Hawking's discovery kickstarted a kind of crisis, right? In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads."
295,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It was one of the most beautiful examples."
296,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Sure, yeah. It's it is a beautiful, beautiful idea."
297,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So first of all, to be totally clear though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted directly."
298,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","I don't think very many people doubt that it's there."
299,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole,"
300,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return. If you fall through that surface,"
301,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","no matter what you have, no matter how powerful of a rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fell from, nothing escapes, not even light. It all gets sucked in and spaghetified and destroyed at the singularity or something something happens."
302,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But it doesn't get out."
303,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely."
304,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit and a microchip,"
305,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","sometimes you discover that it's not actually there and then your computer crashes."
306,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","This is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in reality. You can't precisely say where the electron is and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving."
307,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Exactly. Yeah. So when you get the blue screen of death, that might be because of quantum mechanics."
308,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Right."
309,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole."
310,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Well, it's a surface. It's got a particular radius for around black hole."
311,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And you want to say something is inside or outside it. Well, you can't absolutely say that quantum mechanically."
312,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole."
313,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that mass."
314,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","You can think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being emitted."
315,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And when Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum. It looks like a hot or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron."
316,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles"
317,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","is pretty wild. I think everyone understood that the that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications"
318,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","that it meant something really terrible is happening because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what,"
319,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","is disappearing into these quantum particles, which in some sense have nothing to do with the material that went in."
320,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So do you think that's a big crisis?"
321,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","It's a crisis because of some of the details of it. But I would say the way you just described it,"
322,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","If I build a big bonfire or an incinerator, and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia."
323,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","The information is lost for all practical purposes."
324,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Practical purposes. So this is a huge crisis because either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described, it's the most accurately tested paradigm in the history of physics. How could it be wrong?"
325,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Right? Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity."
326,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","That's true. And this, I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it."
327,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Is there really spacetime or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"

444,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Right. So I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides which are which are actually secretly the same. And on one side there's definitely no gravity. And on the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means."
445,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory where definitely no gravity."
446,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So that's like just saying there's the idea of a dual description is just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions. And so to belabor which one's real is silly."
447,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's like saying is French real or is English real?"
448,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","Right. Yeah, an example I like to give is if you take some extra dimensions, let's say just one, and you compactify them. All that is, it's exactly equivalent to whatever particles you had, whatever fields you had in your original theory before you added. You just add an infinite tower of new particles with certain properties that are all easy to calculate."
449,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","For me, it's a question of which one which description is the most useful."
450,"Speaker 6 (Matthew Kleban)","I mean, if you want to say gravity is an illusion and it's all quantum, that's great. But then you fall down the stairs and bang your head. So."
