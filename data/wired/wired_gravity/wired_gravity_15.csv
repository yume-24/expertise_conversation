207,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you're getting your PhD in physics."
208,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","That's right."
209,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Theoretical high energy physics."
210,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Basically the physics of really, really small fundamental things."
211,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what would that have to do with gravity or astrophysics?"
212,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Well, what I'm looking at is states of matter that might exist inside neutron stars."
213,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So when a star dies, if the star is massive enough, there's a huge explosion called a supernova, and the stuff that's left behind that doesn't get blown away collapses into a tiny compact blob called a neutron star."
214,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what I love about neutron stars personally,"
215,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","is that they're kind of city-sized."
216,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Right."
217,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's right."
218,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's about the size of a city. So you're imagining something more than the mass of the sun. Yep. Or about the mass of the sun condensed to the size of a city. It's dense enough that one teaspoonful would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth."
219,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong, right, around the neutron star."
220,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","That's right."
221,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what would happen if we were on a neutron star?"
222,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Because of gravity?"
223,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","We would, we would immediately be crushed into the ground. I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles."
224,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?"
225,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","So as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother. It's more intense."
226,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole. And those are so dense that spacetime breaks down in some way or another."
227,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Black holes are so amazing that where the neutron star stops and there's something actually there, right? There's a material there."
228,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the uh event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling."
229,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And like you said, maybe spacetime breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star is gone."
230,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That black hole is empty. It's a place and not a thing."
231,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole or is that, should you think of it as there is no spacetime inside?"
232,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet. And that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curve spacetime is beginning to break down. And we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity."
233,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And we don't have that yet."
234,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form."
235,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","The consequences are very much speaking to this curved spacetime."
236,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause spacetime to ring."
237,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And it's very much part of gravitation, the ringing of spacetime itself, we call gravitational waves."
238,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1915, 1916. He was thinking about that."
239,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Those waves are very exciting for me too, because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves. And we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal."
240,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yes, they ring spacetime also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years when it's traveled through the universe."
241,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide. And because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions. It's really quite spectacular."
242,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","That's right. In fact, when we recorded that for the first time with gravitational waves, we then pointed telescopes at it and were able to see it optically as well. And that gave scientists a lot of data."
243,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, it was um, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity."
244,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Wow."
245,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So when the gravitational waves were recorded, and they realized, oh, this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound."
246,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","This sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes. And so like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from."
247,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So from your point of view, I mean, they were like two superconducting giant magnets colliding. An experiment you could never do on Earth."
248,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's just of the most tremendous scales and and peculiarities of matter."
249,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Absolutely."
250,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the uh neutron star collision that caused that."
251,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, it's amazing. It's literally populating the periodic table."
252,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Yes, we now think that most of the heavy elements after some number are created in neutron star collisions."
253,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you are already a PhD student. You know a lot about gravity, but what do you think you've taken away from this conversation?"
254,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","Well, I've definitely taken away that the way that we think about gravity today is very different from how Newton thought about it. Um, and that even though we have a very good understanding, there's lots of things that we don't fully understand."
255,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","There's still a lot of questions to be answered, which I think is really exciting."
256,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you're a scientist."
257,"Speaker 5 (Will Gyory)","(laughs) Isn't the best part being able to ask the questions?"
258,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Oh yeah."
