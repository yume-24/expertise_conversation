1,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Hi, I'm Janna Levin, I'm an astrophysicist and I've been asked to explain gravity in five levels of increasing complexity."
2,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Gravity seems so familiar and so everyday and yet it's this incredibly esoteric, abstract subject that has shaped the way we view the universe on the largest scales, has given us the strangest phenomenon in the universe like black holes"
3,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","that has changed the way we look at the entirety of physics, it's really been a revolution because of gravity."
4,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Are you interested in science?"
5,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Yes."
6,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yes, you are?"
7,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Yes."
8,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Do you know what gravity is?"
9,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","It's something that so right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity, we're sitting right down on these chairs."
10,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's pretty good."
11,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth and the Earth to us, but the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much."
12,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","You know the moon pulls on the Earth a little bit."
13,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Mhmm, just like um with the ocean tides?"
14,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Exactly, well the moon is such a big body"
15,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect pulling the water of the Earth."
16,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But more than the moon, think about the sun pulling on the Earth, we orbit the whole sun just the way the Earth pulls on the moon and causes the moon to orbit us."
17,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","All of those things are acting on you and me right now."
18,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?"
19,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's such a good question. No, we actually couldn't."
20,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","The moon gravity is weaker, can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the moon."
21,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, on the Earth it's harder 'cause it's bigger. If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder."
22,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk, the gravity is just way too strong."
23,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Do you know how tall you are?"
24,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","I'm in the fours."
25,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","In the fours?"
26,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Maybe 4'3"."
27,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing and walking or sitting that gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly so that in the morning, you might be a little bit taller than in the evening."
28,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","See if it works for you."
29,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Whoa."
30,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But that was last night?"
31,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Yes."
32,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Cool."
33,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","They say that astronauts in space definitely their spinal elongates."
34,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station, was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother."
35,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Wow."
36,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated. After a while here on Earth though, he'll readjust, they'll go back to the same size."
37,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?"
38,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Mhmm."
39,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall? There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head."
40,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Ooh."
41,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works."
42,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","I don't actually think it's a true story though."
43,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Yeah, but it's a good story."
44,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter."
45,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That that's the same. Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time."
46,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Hm."
47,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","So, if we both dropped down from a plane, we would both um land at the same time, but you would land heavier?"
48,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah."
49,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yep. So like a penny from the Empire state building will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball."
50,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Oh my god. Yeah."
51,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Amazing."
52,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Wanna try it?"
53,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Um, yeah."
54,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","A light object."
55,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","See how light that is?"
56,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","That's very light."
57,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah?"
58,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And a heavy object."
59,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Oh my god."
60,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","They look the same. But this is much heavier, right?"
61,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Okay, so try it. Just try holding your arms out front and a little higher maybe, give him a chance to drop and then drop them."
62,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","(laughs)"
63,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Did they fall at the same time?"
64,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","They hit at the same time."
65,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Did they hit at the same time?"
66,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","Hm."
67,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the sun."
68,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And that's a huge leap. Here he is looking at just things around him"
69,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization that that's actually the same force."
70,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what have you learned today talking about gravity?"
71,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","I've learned that the person that learned about the apple. He was learning about gravity just about what he saw on this planet."
72,"Speaker 2 (Bonét Sofía Kanayet)","I also learned that if you drop one light thing and one heavy thing at the same height at the same time, they're both going to drop at the same time, but one's going to drop a little heavier than the other."
73,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's beautiful. I'm impressed."
