74,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So, Maria, you're in high school?"
75,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Yeah, I'm a junior."
76,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And are you studying any sciences in high school?"
77,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Um taking physics right now."
78,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Do you think of yourself as curious about science?"
79,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Well, there are like some things that interest me and others that bore me, so it like depends."
80,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","What interests you?"
81,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Well, like I'm a gymnast, so like in physics they talk about like force and stuff and then I think of like how I use physics in like my own life."
82,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","What's your impression of what gravity is?"
83,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","I think that if there's like no gravity, everyone would like float everywhere. It like pulls things down and without it like everything would just be like chaos."
84,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you're saying gravity pulls things down."
85,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yet we've launched things into space. Have you ever wondered how we do that?"
86,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Well is it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough, it'll like go in the opposite direction?"
87,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Well, that's true. We do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system. So for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to like speed up."
88,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But mostly around the Earth, gravity pulls things down. So when we want to send a rocket into space, when we want to go to the moon, when we want to send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth."
89,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down?"
90,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Mhmm."
91,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's actually not true."
92,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again. And that's basically how rocket launches work."
93,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second. Think about how fast it is. Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers. If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again. So you know the International Space Station, which is orbiting the Earth?"
94,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's going around the Earth at like 17,000 miles an hour."
95,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It has no engines anymore. The engines are turned off."
96,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So it's just there falling forever. So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that."
97,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","And like does the gravity pull it or is it just like floating?"
98,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","In a weird way that is gravity pulling it."
99,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So if you ever um had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this, the string is pulling it in at all times."
100,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But you've also given it this angular momentum. And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit."
101,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times. So that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line. It keeps coming back around."
102,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity. And that's not the case at all. They're absolutely feeling gravity."
103,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","They're just cruising so fast that even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface."
104,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","It's like that um the ride at the roller coasters where you like you go in and it spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but like you're pulled You feel pinned to the back?"
105,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's exactly like that."
106,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized and especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth, or if you were in a rocket ship that was accelerating."
107,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","That's crazy."
108,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","You ever had that experience where you're sitting on a train and the other one moves? And for a second, you're not sure if you're the one moving?"
109,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Yeah, cause like I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train."
110,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","And then I'm like, wait, what?"
111,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's because in some sense you're really not. Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion. There's no absolute motion. So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room. Isn't that kind of crazy?"
112,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","That makes sense."
113,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So imagine you are an astronaut and you are floating in empty space. You can't see anything. There's no stars, there's no Earth. You can ask yourself, am I moving? There's really no way for you to tell. So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving. So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you. Maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second. And you say, Marina, you're cruising at like thousands of kilometers a second. You're going so fast. But she had just done the same experiment. She was just floating in space, thinking, you know, am I moving?"
114,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","There's no way to know which one of you is moving. And there's no meaning to the absolute motion. The only thing that's true is that you are in relative motion. That's true. You both agree you are in relative motion."
115,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's clear, but neither of you can say, it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary."
116,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So let me tell you where it gets really crazy."
117,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","(laughs)"
118,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving."
119,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Let's say you both see a flash of light."
120,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where."
121,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second. But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse as far as you can tell."
122,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right? So you would say, oh Marina's gonna measure a different speed of light. But she comes back and she says, nope, 300,000 kilometers per second."
123,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Because from her perspective, she's standing still. And the laws of physics have better be the same for her."
124,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity. And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light,"
125,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion. Which one of you should it be? So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of light."
126,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","How could that possibly, possibly be the case? And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel,"
127,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","your spatial distance in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time."
128,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina."
129,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Wow."
130,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","You have the best expression on your face right now."
131,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","(laughs) That's crazy."
132,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's pretty wild, but that is the starting point actually of the whole theory of relativity. That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a big bang and black holes and spacetime."
133,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Just from that one simple starting point."
134,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?"
135,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","Yeah, 'cause like I knew that like when I was on the train, I didn't feel like I was moving, but I didn't know like why or that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy. (laughs)"
136,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And it's a really deep principle. And what about the theory of gravity?"
137,"Speaker 3 (Maria Teresa Furtado)","I don't know. Like usually when I just hear gravity, it's like from my coaches, but I didn't know like it was like all these things. Mhmm."
138,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's like a big paradigm."
