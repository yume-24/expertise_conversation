139,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you're in college?"
140,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Yes."
141,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And what are you studying in college?"
142,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","I am a physics major."
143,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?"
144,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","I'm taught that it's a force. Uh it's described by inverse law, but I also know that it's a field. And there's a recent discovery with like gravitational waves. Although I don't know like the specific details of about that."
145,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So when you say it's an inverse square law, Yeah. That means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull."
146,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And that makes sense 'cause very few things are stronger when you're further apart."
147,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah. So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space, even though the Earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance, right? That we're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point."
148,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And that's nice because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, Yeah. the way the old fashioned inverse square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as like mind bending with spoons that it's like telekinesis. If you don't touch something, how do you affect it?"
149,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of space. And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's stronger very close to the Earth."
150,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So one way to think of this field is as a field that's really describing a curved spacetime that is everywhere."
151,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations."
152,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","One was uh what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life."
153,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So right now, you might feel heavy in your chair. And we might feel heavy on the floor in our feet or or standing in an elevator cab. And Einstein would have said, what does the chair have to do with it? Or the floor or the elevator?"
154,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Those aren't gravitational objects. And so he wanted to eliminate them. And one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can't see out of a black box."
155,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall."
156,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","So in free fall?"
157,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","You're in total free fall."
158,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Now, because things fall at the same rate, Yeah. including the elevator and you, Yeah. you can actually float in the elevator. If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop."
159,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And you might not even know you're falling. You could take an apple and drop it in front of you and it would float in front of you. You would actually experience weightlessness."
160,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It's called the equivalence principle."
161,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field. And that was the first step to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling."
162,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","I know like uh zero gravity experiences are done with uh"
163,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","planes, I believe. Yeah, exactly."
164,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah. You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free falling. The plane just drops out of the air. And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily."
165,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So the plane has to scoop back up. And then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane. Because then the plane is interrupting their fall."
166,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So that's the first thought. And then the next is what is the shape that's traced? So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space Yeah. and you had an apple and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would trace?"
167,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","The path."
168,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Well, if I threw it straight, I would think it would go straight."
169,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, it would just go straight."
170,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?"
171,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Uh, it would just go down."
172,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, but it would cause trace a curve. Trace an arc."
173,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Right? And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc."
174,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So the second step to thinking about curved space time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths as though space time itself, space itself was curved."
175,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Oh."
176,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And so you had that moment. I saw it on your face. You went oh."
177,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Yeah."
178,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So that's the intuition. That's how Einstein gets from thinking that space time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, but what it's really describing is the curves that things fall along."
179,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description."
180,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","That's really hard, but that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments."
181,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","That's amazing."
182,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Isn't it kind of amazing?"
183,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So you described learning in a class about light, the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light"
184,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","and questioning the absolute nature of space and time. And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity."
185,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","But he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity."
186,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So suppose the sun were to disappear tomorrow. Some like evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the sun. In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth."
187,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light."
188,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","No information, not even information about the sun could possibly travel faster than the speed of light. So we shouldn't know about what happened to the sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us."
189,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity."
190,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes, if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth,"
191,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","and I look at how things fall, and I see that they follow curves, well then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve."
192,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Oh."
193,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying, if the sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the sun imprinted in spacetime would actually begin to ripple."
194,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And those are the gravitational waves and they would change and they would flatten out because the sun was no longer there."
195,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And that would take the light travel time to get to us to tell us that the sun was gone."
196,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","And then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line."
197,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Wow."
198,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Wow."
199,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Yeah."
200,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Well, let's hope it doesn't happen."
201,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Yeah."
202,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So what do you think you walked away with? What do you think you learned from the conversation?"
203,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Well, I learned more about the intuitions behind the concept. Um, 'cause we already just do the problems, but sometimes you get lost in the math, but like speaking like this, it's really helps build my intuition."
204,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","Yeah, it does for me too."
205,"Speaker 1 (Janna Levin)","So thank you."
206,"Speaker 4 (Lisa Chan)","Yeah."
