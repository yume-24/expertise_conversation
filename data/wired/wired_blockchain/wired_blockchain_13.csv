25,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So Ian, do you know what blockchain is?","Teen segment"
26,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","No.","Teen segment"
27,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Have you ever traded or sold anything?","Teen segment"
28,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","Actually I'm selling my computer on eBay right now.","Teen segment"
29,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","That's amazing.","Teen segment"
30,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","What made you decide to trade on eBay?","Teen segment"
31,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","Um, well, I mean I've heard of it and I trust it a lot because they have like all their guarantees.","Teen segment"
32,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","So I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want.","Teen segment"
33,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing but it goes to you and I directly?","Teen segment"
34,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between.","Teen segment"
35,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","That's cool.","Teen segment"
36,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right?","Teen segment"
37,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We have a lot of banks.","Teen segment"
38,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen.","Teen segment"
39,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of like a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between.","Teen segment"
40,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","So how does it work?","Teen segment"
41,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions.","Teen segment"
42,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And so instead of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people.","Teen segment"
43,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Like you could have it on your computer, and then it gets validated by everyone.","Teen segment"
44,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And basically that turns into the next part of the list, so it's sort of constantly updating itself.","Teen segment"
45,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","So like how do you make sure that it's secure?","Teen segment"
46,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So it uses cryptography.","Teen segment"
47,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And that helps it basically encode all of the transactions.","Teen segment"
48,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you know it happened because it's like a marker.","Teen segment"
49,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So you could kind of like, I don't know, say trade apples, but you would just see like random letters for it.","Teen segment"
50,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","Yeah, for it so you wouldn't be able to like track it, I guess.","Teen segment"
51,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Exactly.","Teen segment"
52,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","That's cool.","Teen segment"
53,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So it's kind of this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded.","Teen segment"
54,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody.","Teen segment"
55,"Speaker 3 (Teen - Ian)","That's cool.","Teen segment"
56,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah.","Teen segment"
