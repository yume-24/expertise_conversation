57,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We're going to talk about blockchain technology.","College segment"
58,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Have you heard of blockchain?","College segment"
59,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I've heard of the words blockchain but I'm not sure I know what it is.","College segment"
60,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So when we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily.","College segment"
61,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But as the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right?","College segment"
62,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","If you use Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon, even these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value.","College segment"
63,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But today we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one-to-one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology.","College segment"
64,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","There is some kind of interface for it; you could have an app or you could use your computer to do it.","College segment"
65,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But instead of there being a company in the middle, or what's helping you make that transaction is a bunch of software code.","College segment"
66,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node.","College segment"
67,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen.","College segment"
68,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I mean I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen in some cases.","College segment"
69,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah it is.","College segment"
70,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And a lot of people in the financial industry in particular are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency.","College segment"
71,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","You know, a lot of people think about blockchain as bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot and it's this new cryptocurrency and it's kind of exciting.","College segment"
72,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side.","College segment"
73,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","They're more around how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using the same technology.","College segment"
74,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?","College segment"
75,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So today a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchain.","College segment"
76,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute.","College segment"
77,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So your government could sign that you have a U.S. passport.","College segment"
78,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student.","College segment"
79,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as-needed basis.","College segment"
