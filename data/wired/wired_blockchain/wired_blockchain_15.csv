Sequence,Speaker,Utterance,Notes
80,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So today we're going to talk about blockchain technology.","Grad student segment"
81,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Okay, have you ever heard of blockchain?","Grad student segment"
82,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","I have.","Grad student segment"
83,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Whenever we have a transaction and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged and it gets verified by a third person or third party.","Grad student segment"
84,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right?","Grad student segment"
85,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And it gets stored.","Grad student segment"
86,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And when we make further transactions, this information is already embedded—it's in the ledger.","Grad student segment"
87,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah that's exactly right.","Grad student segment"
88,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And you can append it—you can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything.","Grad student segment"
89,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Absolutely right.","Grad student segment"
90,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","The way the technology is changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be.","Grad student segment"
91,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And there's no like firm and then the buyer and the seller.","Grad student segment"
92,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And it's basically we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules and economics as well for sure.","Grad student segment"
93,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","A lot of the assumptions won't hold true.","Grad student segment"
94,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Same with who are the actors—it's not just people anymore; it's machines.","Grad student segment"
95,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Absolutely.","Grad student segment"
96,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We're going to have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us too.","Grad student segment"
97,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","What kind of barriers or roadblocks would you imagine are going to happen in the blockchain space?","Grad student segment"
98,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So at least when we talk about bitcoin, there are some trust issues.","Grad student segment"
99,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","There have been some hacks.","Grad student segment"
100,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So there is obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's the safe technology.","Grad student segment"
101,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah, one of the problems that bitcoin has faced is bitcoins getting stolen or lost.","Grad student segment"
102,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize bitcoin in different ways, making themselves actually a pretty easy target.","Grad student segment"
103,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","Absolutely.","Grad student segment"
104,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","So education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in the wide sense, right?","Grad student segment"
105,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah, to actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards, and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of the user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable.","Grad student segment"
106,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding? What's going to have to happen next?","Grad student segment"
107,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","The current state is in the research state.","Grad student segment"
108,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","And it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas.","Grad student segment"
109,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","It might be used almost everywhere, to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it.","Grad student segment"
110,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","But I'm not sure where it's going to go—I mean no one really knows, right?","Grad student segment"
111,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Well, we have a lot of public blockchains—like we have Bitcoin, we have the Ethereum network, NXT.","Grad student segment"
112,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains.","Grad student segment"
113,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network when people feel comfortable using it.","Grad student segment"
114,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And some are also proof of concepts out in the real world—projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail.","Grad student segment"
115,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And lots of different fields are starting experiments, and we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade.","Grad student segment"
