116,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","So tell me your version of a technical definition of blockchain.","Expert segment"
117,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","A technical definition of blockchain is that it is a persistent, transparent, public, append-only ledger.","Expert segment"
118,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","So it is a system that you can add data to and not change previous data within it.","Expert segment"
119,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It does this through a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered or distributed parties that do not need to trust each other but just need to trust the mechanism by which their consensus has arrived at.","Expert segment"
120,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","In the case of blockchain, it relies on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network.","Expert segment"
121,"Speaker 1 (Expert)","So it randomizes the process.","Expert segment"
122,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yes.","Expert segment"
123,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Yeah, it randomizes the process and in theory ensures that no one can force the blockchain to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with.","Expert segment"
124,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","One that relies on a mechanism for a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and then verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter after the fact.","Expert segment"
125,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And do you see it as defining a new discipline of kinds, or where are we going to see blockchain emerge in the real world?","Expert segment"
126,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","First, I mean just so like as an example, one thing that I think about a lot in terms of possible blockchain applications is electricity.","Expert segment"
127,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","The next generation of distributed smart grid technology, effectively.","Expert segment"
128,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Sure.","Expert segment"
129,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And people are working on that already.","Expert segment"
130,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yeah.","Expert segment"
131,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Yeah exactly, and it's this very fruitful area of research.","Expert segment"
132,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right?","Expert segment"
133,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Where you have an enormous number of electric cars, you have all of these batteries.","Expert segment"
134,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Like that's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right?","Expert segment"
135,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Like the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times.","Expert segment"
136,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","If you have a mechanism that is able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes, their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware.","Expert segment"
137,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","You begin to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables.","Expert segment"
138,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather.","Expert segment"
139,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","That is able to have power much closer to where it's needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances.","Expert segment"
140,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","That's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve.","Expert segment"
141,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible.","Expert segment"
142,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of initial coin offerings—this sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain—and are getting very excited about it.","Expert segment"
143,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And some of that excitement is real and should be encouraged, but some of it is also hype.","Expert segment"
144,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?","Expert segment"
145,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","I'm glad you mentioned initial coin offerings, because for me those really exemplify the problem that we're having at this exact moment.","Expert segment"
146,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","They are an idea with enormous potential significance down the road.","Expert segment"
147,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","However, the promise of the initial coin offering has been kind of hijacked into this string of basically pump-and-dump scams or desperate gold rush schemes.","Expert segment"
148,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","The faster that we can shift from this fantasy that it is going to make you rich in a sort of 1920s tulip-bubble kind of way, the sooner that we can get into people being disappointed in blockchains—like, 'oh I didn't get rich.'","Expert segment"
149,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","It's just being used now to make it easier to transact goods and services safely across borders.","Expert segment"
150,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","This isn't exciting at all.","Expert segment"
151,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And then we'll see that become part of the everyday infrastructure of the world in a way that I think will be very significant.","Expert segment"
152,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","But I think it is now: almost every aspect of it that's connected with the concept of money is wildly overhyped.","Expert segment"
153,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And it also creates a problem, which is people get a lot of excitement around it and then they're waiting for the world to change—like, where is this technology, why haven't I seen anything changing?","Expert segment"
154,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Yes, yes, because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept.","Expert segment"
155,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But yeah, truthfully this is more like a science: it will develop, it will take five years, it will take 10 years.","Expert segment"
156,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","That kind of time is necessary.","Expert segment"
157,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just going to see blockchain emerge—we're going to see artificial intelligence continue to evolve.","Expert segment"
158,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We're gonna see connected devices and this sort of growing internet of things machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own.","Expert segment"
159,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust.","Expert segment"
160,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins—assign properties to a particular coin.","Expert segment"
161,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions.","Expert segment"
162,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","There's sort of an obvious application for this: something that would look a little bit like an extreme version of a boycott/divestment/sanctions kind of approach.","Expert segment"
163,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","A model where it's sort of like: I will not touch money; my wallet will automatically not touch money that has been exchanged with the following.","Expert segment"
164,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","As a sort of very extreme way of cutting those things out.","Expert segment"
165,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","But there's also ways in which I think that could be applied to clearing out the entire logistics process of many kinds of bad actors.","Expert segment"
166,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","But trying to make a supply chain better in some ways relies a lot on whose version of better that is and exactly what gets qualified, but also how that is quantified within, say, some kind of smart contract system.","Expert segment"
167,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","There's multiple ways that I could see this backfiring.","Expert segment"
168,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","One is the ways in which that is implemented—for example, leaving certain kinds of bad behavior untouched or unanalyzed.","Expert segment"
169,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Or one that feels even more dire to me is creating an extremely inflexible—because human contracts, legal contracts are actually very flexible.","Expert segment"
170,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Like there's a lot of room to move and renegotiate.","Expert segment"
171,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Yeah, but we already have real-world versions of some of these nightmare scenarios.","Expert segment"
172,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Right? Like your kid has a medical emergency and you can't unlock your car because you're two days behind on payments for it.","Expert segment"
173,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","And so the car system will no longer respond to the app mechanism that you're supposed to be able to use to drive it.","Expert segment"
174,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Barrier being sort of a rigidity in structures that maybe don't accommodate real life scenarios very well.","Expert segment"
175,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","As you and I have been talking, one of the things that keeps coming up is that we tend to hold novel technologies to an unrealistically high standard in terms of what they are supposed to deliver rather than comparing them to actually existing systems.","Expert segment"
176,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Where we can begin to see the possibility that even a slight incremental improvement would still be an enormous gain.","Expert segment"
177,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","The system we have today is also broken.","Expert segment"
178,"Speaker 6 (Expert)","Right.","Expert segment"
179,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","It's hard to compare it to some perfect future.","Expert segment"
180,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Just like we compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it—should be perfect, right? There should be zero car deaths.","Expert segment"
181,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And when you say, well there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today, I think we're in a similar place.","Expert segment"
182,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility.","Expert segment"
183,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","But it's going to also be a version—a system that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today.","Expert segment"
184,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","Blockchain may sound complicated, but at its core it's just another tool for humans and eventually robots and other kinds of identities to trade at scale and make that trade more decentralized.","Expert segment"
185,"Speaker 1 (Bettina Warburg)","And it's part of our future, so it's important that people have these kinds of conversations and start to learn about it.","Expert segment"
