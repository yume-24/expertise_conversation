63,"Brian Greene, PhD","If I was to ask you, what is time?"
64,"Brian Greene, PhD","What would you say?"
65,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","Time is kind of strange because it's almost a man-made idea. There is the tangible of, you know, how the Earth revolves around the sun or how we orbit around ourselves."
66,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","It's almost in a way, does it exist if the way that we measure it is man-made?"
67,"Brian Greene, PhD","Before there was any life on planet Earth, I think we all agree the universe existed. Did things change before there was life on Earth? And how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time?"
68,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","It's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it."
69,"Brian Greene, PhD","Even if it is a human-made concept, that the universe evolved, developed, changed through time ultimately giving rise to galaxies, stars, planets, and on this particular planet, life. That conception of time gives a feel that it's like universal, that it's out there. It's the same for everybody. It's independent of our actions or activities."
70,"Brian Greene, PhD","Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time?"
71,"Brian Greene, PhD","He found that if you and I, say have identical wristwatches, I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock is ticking off time more slowly than my clock."
72,"Brian Greene, PhD","But you know it's really remarkable? You can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant."
73,"Brian Greene, PhD","Have you ever heard that phrase?"
74,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","My freshman year physics class."
75,"Brian Greene, PhD","Yeah. And if you're clever, you can use that with high school algebra, maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier, to derive that clocks tick off time at a different rate. Do you want me to show you how that goes?"
76,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","Yes, please."
77,"Brian Greene, PhD","All right. So, to figure out the effect of motion on time, I'm going to use a really simple clock. It's called a light clock."
78,"Brian Greene, PhD","It's two mirrors that are facing each other. And what we do is we have a little ball of light, called a photon, right, that goes up, hits the top mirror, then comes back down and hits the bottom mirror. And every time it does that, we go tick tock. That's one unit of time."
79,"Brian Greene, PhD","Imagine now, we have another one of these light clocks, but I'm going to have it in motion."
80,"Brian Greene, PhD","Now, what do you notice about that path?"
81,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","It's much longer."
82,"Brian Greene, PhD","It's much longer, right?"
83,"Brian Greene, PhD","This one's going tick tock. This one's going to go tick tock."
84,"Brian Greene, PhD","In fact, we can figure out the ratio. Let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock."
85,"Brian Greene, PhD","Well, that ratio is going to be the ratio of the lengths. Then this would be given by D over L. More time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock. Well, this length over here, that's the same as this L over here."
86,"Brian Greene, PhD","All right? So we want D over L."
87,"Brian Greene, PhD","Now, you may have recalled that in trigonometry, there's a name for L over D. Sin of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right?"
88,"Brian Greene, PhD","And so, this ratio is just 1 over sin of theta."
89,"Brian Greene, PhD","So if we can figure out 1 over sin theta, we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time on the stationary clock to time on the moving clock. We just need one other fact."
90,"Brian Greene, PhD","The speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C. C equals speed of light."
91,"Brian Greene, PhD","But in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror, the component of the speed of light in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace with the speed of the clock itself. So let's assume that this clock is moving in this direction with the speed equal to V. So C times cosine theta must be equal to V, the speed of the clock."
92,"Brian Greene, PhD","And from this, we learn that cosine theta is equal to V over C."
93,"Brian Greene, PhD","There's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry, that sin squared theta plus cosine squared theta is equal to one. This is really just the Pythagorean theorem in disguise. Sin squared theta plus (V/C) squared is 1."
94,"Brian Greene, PhD","And from that, we can now solve for sin squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared."
95,"Brian Greene, PhD","And now for sin theta is the square root of this. And now we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sin theta, which now is 1 over the square root of 1 minus V over C squared."
96,"Brian Greene, PhD","So you see, as V gets very close to C, this gets very close to one. 1 minus something very close to one is very close to zero. 1 over something close to zero is huge!"
97,"Brian Greene, PhD","Which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time on the moving, that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light."
98,"Brian Greene, PhD","Now, I did this for a light clock, but it's true for any clock. And this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity."
99,"Maria Guseva (Teen)","Do you think that in the near or foreseeable future of humans as we know ourselves now, will there be a time where we are using these formulas and these concepts in our daily lives?"
100,"Brian Greene, PhD","As technology progresses, the barrier between the limitations of experience and the truth of how the world behaves in extreme environments will be moved in the very same way that, you know, we can toss a pack of gum and we know where to put our other hand to catch it. Will we have that kind of intuition about these ideas? I think it's quite possible."
