1,"Brian Greene, PhD","I'm Brian Greene and today I have been challenged to explain a topic in five levels of difficulty."
2,"Brian Greene, PhD","We're going to be talking about the nature of time,"
3,"Brian Greene, PhD","the most familiar and the most mysterious quality of the physical universe."
4,"Brian Greene, PhD","There is nothing that we experience that does not take place in some duration of time. So if you can understand time, you're on your way to understanding reality."
5,"Brian Greene, PhD","Hello."
6,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Hello."
7,"Brian Greene, PhD","What's your name?"
8,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Kayla."
9,"Brian Greene, PhD","How old are you, Kayla?"
10,"Kayla Martini (Child)","I am nine years old."
11,"Brian Greene, PhD","So, if you are nine years old, what does that mean about the Earth? How many times has it gone around the sun?"
12,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Nine times."
13,"Brian Greene, PhD","Nine times."
14,"Brian Greene, PhD","So, there's a relationship between motion through space, the Earth is going through space, and the passage of time."
15,"Brian Greene, PhD","They're kind of connected"
16,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Yeah."
17,"Brian Greene, PhD","in some way. But there are differences, right?"
18,"Brian Greene, PhD","If I asked you to move through space, you could do it freely, right?"
19,"Brian Greene, PhD","Can you get up? And let's see how easy it is to move through space."
20,"Brian Greene, PhD","Can you move over to that location?"
21,"Brian Greene, PhD","And can you come back?"
22,"Brian Greene, PhD","Anything getting in your way?"
23,"Brian Greene, PhD","Easy to do?"
24,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Yep."
25,"Brian Greene, PhD","If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space, can you do that?"
26,"Brian Greene, PhD","I mean, hold perfectly still."
27,"Brian Greene, PhD","That's good."
28,"Brian Greene, PhD","But if I ask you to hold still in time, to not go to the next second or the next second,"
29,"Brian Greene, PhD","Can you do that?"
30,"Kayla Martini (Child)","No."
31,"Brian Greene, PhD","So there's definitely this difference between space and time. Some fundamental quality that distinguishes how freely we can move through space versus how freely we can move through time."
32,"Brian Greene, PhD","Have you heard of Albert Einstein?"
33,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Yes."
34,"Brian Greene, PhD","What do you know about him?"
35,"Kayla Martini (Child)","He has crazy hair."
36,"Brian Greene, PhD","He does have crazy hair. And I think I may be heading in that direction actually."
37,"Brian Greene, PhD","He showed us an approach to travel to the future. You want me to tell you how you do it?"
38,"Brian Greene, PhD","You build a spaceship, you go out into space really quickly, you turn around and you come back to planet Earth."
39,"Brian Greene, PhD","And he showed us that when you're on that ship, your clock will tick off time more slowly. You will age more slowly. So that journey may only take you say a year, six months out and six months back."
40,"Brian Greene, PhD","But you know what? When you step out of the ship, it'll be a hundred years into the future or a thousand years, a million years into the future."
41,"Brian Greene, PhD","Would you do that if you could?"
42,"Kayla Martini (Child)","I would probably be dead by then."
43,"Brian Greene, PhD","No, you'd be alive. That's the amazing thing. I'd be dead. Everybody else would be dead who stayed on Earth. But your body would only age one year, and yet it would be a thousand years into the future."
44,"Brian Greene, PhD","The question though is, could you get back? And I don't know the answer to that. Nobody does."
45,"Brian Greene, PhD","We don't know if you can travel back, but we certainly know that you can travel forward."
46,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Has anyone ever tried to go forward and back?"
47,"Brian Greene, PhD","I don't think so."
48,"Brian Greene, PhD","That same guy with the crazy hair, Albert Einstein showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go."
49,"Brian Greene, PhD","And you know what the limit is? The limit is the speed of light."
50,"Brian Greene, PhD","Because light travels 671 million miles per hour. That is fast enough to go around the entire Earth seven times in one second."
51,"Brian Greene, PhD","So if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted."
52,"Brian Greene, PhD","There's something else that's really curious about time. Things tend to go in one direction, and we call it the arrow of time. It sort of points from the past into what we call the future."
53,"Brian Greene, PhD","If you were to ask me why is there an arrow to time?"
54,"Brian Greene, PhD","Ask me."
55,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Why is there an arrow to time?"
56,"Brian Greene, PhD","I'm not really sure. I have some ideas, but I'd say we've still not completely nailed it down."
57,"Brian Greene, PhD","Kayla, what have you learned about time from talking about it here?"
58,"Kayla Martini (Child)","That you can't really travel back through time."
59,"Brian Greene, PhD","And can you travel to the future in principle?"
60,"Kayla Martini (Child)","Maybe."
61,"Brian Greene, PhD","Maybe. That's absolutely right."
62,"Brian Greene, PhD","I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past, but it's not been ruled out. That's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility."
