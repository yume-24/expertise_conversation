128,"Brian Greene, PhD","Have you started any projects yet, or that's"
129,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","I'm just starting one right now."
130,"Brian Greene, PhD","What's it on?"
131,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","I'm trying to figure out how stars in the galaxy are moving based on what they're made of, which is interesting."
132,"Brian Greene, PhD","Clearly time comes in to what you're doing. To what extent do you have to grapple with some of the subtle features of time?"
133,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","Yeah, with my research in particular, I really want to know what happened in the past and what happened in the future, but you only get a single snapshot when you look up at the night sky. Right. And so we can learn a lot by looking at other galaxies and seeing what they were doing in in their present, I suppose. Yeah. Just figuring out what's going to happen next is is part of part of the issue, right? That's looking into the future, I suppose."
134,"Brian Greene, PhD","And so, have you taken General Relativity, or you taking that now, or?"
135,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","I took a course on General Relativity, yeah."
136,"Brian Greene, PhD","But you learned about black holes?"
137,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","Sure."
138,"Brian Greene, PhD","One of the weird things, and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will, shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space. But once you have a shortcut from here to there, the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings, time will elapse differently at the different openings. So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines. Go one direction, you're going into the future, go the other direction, you'd be going into the past. But that of course raises philosophical and logical paradoxes and sorts."
139,"Brian Greene, PhD","So what do you think? What do you I throw it to you."
140,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","Yeah, I I've heard a few different theories that people posit. Like, maybe it is back to the future and you really change your own universe. I've also heard people say that you could have multiple universes spawn from this event or something along these lines."
141,"Brian Greene, PhD","Yeah, that's if you're going to be able to change the past. That's the one that resonates most with me. I think the same. Yeah. So you go into the past, and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting, but you're preventing them from meeting in a parallel reality, which means that you will never be born in that reality. But the origin of your birth is still completely understood. It was in the universe from which you originated."
142,"Brian Greene, PhD","Another one that's more subtle is the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding. Right. And that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will."
143,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","I'm immediately uncomfortable."
144,"Brian Greene, PhD","Yeah. So that one, there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski, who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole, comes out, and hits the very ball that was going into the hole. And in that way, if it could knock it off course, we seem to be in some logical paradox. Absolutely. But the finding was the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one, but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening."
145,"Brian Greene, PhD","And the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one universe, not parallel universes like in the other solution, moments in time just are."
146,"Brian Greene, PhD","They don't change. The whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen. So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events, there's no conception of them changing."
147,"Brian Greene, PhD","So whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet, they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment."
148,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","Do you think travel back to the past is impossible because of of a deep physical like mathematical reasoning or just because of all of these problems that that you've been talking about?"
149,"Brian Greene, PhD","I suspect that when we fully understand the mathematics of the final physical laws, if we ever come upon them, I think there's going to be something built in Okay. that prevents this kind of free travel to the past. But sometimes I I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from these kind of paradoxes."
150,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","So defeatist maybe even?"
151,"Brian Greene, PhD","To defeatist? I think that's the perfect way to put it. Because it might be a brief flicker on a single mote of dust like floating in a cosmic eternity. Yeah. But it's everything. Yeah. There's nothing else that I'll ever experience. And so in a way, there's there's nothing else to me."
152,"Alexander Novara (Grad Student)","Yeah."
153,"Brian Greene, PhD","It can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing where none of what we do sort of persists."
154,"Brian Greene, PhD","On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around and say, how remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel"
155,"Brian Greene, PhD","and love and explore and illuminate. Wow."
156,"Brian Greene, PhD","How wonderful is that?"
157,"Brian Greene, PhD","So often when we try to give the basic idea of what time is, I'm fond of saying, look, space is the language that allows us to say where events take place and time is the language that allows us to specify when they take place. Where would you jump off from there and trying to give a deeper understanding of the basics of time?"
158,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","Maybe part of the distinction in between time and space, it's that you have a clear irreversible evolution."
159,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","So how to explain what time is? Well, it's a parameter that is measured by clocks. I mean, at the end, this is what we know."
160,"Brian Greene, PhD","And allows us to talk about change."
161,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","And also that we know how to describe in terms of some set of equations which gives a clear sense of causality."
162,"Brian Greene, PhD","To note our recent paper where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity, but in a setting where the global shape of the spacetime, suppose imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space, a circular dimension, and thought about how special relativity works in that setting."
163,"Brian Greene, PhD","We came to the result in this very basic setting, you can send signals into the past, not in a way that will violate causality. Did that surprise you that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space?"
164,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","But making that one change, you could have this radical impact. I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple, totally classical. There was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified, identified on a circle."
165,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat spacetime."
166,"Brian Greene, PhD","And the beauty of it is, it's not like there was some high-powered mathematical methodology."
167,"Brian Greene, PhD","Straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results. And they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality, we discovered that a fast moving observer that could be us on a rocket could send signals very far and then back in a very small time."
168,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","And so that shows uh how even ideas that seem to be well settled and well understood have surprises."
169,"Massimo Porrati (Expert)","Like why didn't Einstein realize this? Yeah, maybe the idea of uh living on a subspace or being confined in this extra dimension on a surface may have been looked exotic, but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s. Many people have begun thinking about the possibility that space and time may be so-called emergent quantities. Yes. That they're not as fundamental as perhaps Newton or Einstein would have thought. Where do you stand on that idea? It seems uh not unthinkable saying that something is emergent will make full sense only when we have some concrete model in which space and time emerge and in which we make sense of this non-space non-time description of of a theory. I don't know if we are still at the stage in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario because uh often I tell my students greatest scientific revolution has been not in the 20th century, it has not been quantum mechanics, nor general relativity, nor special relativity, it has been the passage from qualitative description of nature to quantitative one when you pass from asking how to how much then you understand something. And who do you credit with that? Is that Newton? Do you go Newton or a little bit below to Galileo? I would say Galileo Newton, of course the the completion of this idea is Newton. One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists? That if someone's moving relative to me, what they consider now might be in my past. What they consider now might be in my future, which would suggest that all of time exists, much as we're willing to accept that all of space exists. Does that hold water? Actually it uh resonates with me for various reasons. One is that professionally we use space-time diagrams, Penrose diagrams, a lot of uh diagrams where space and times are just two axes on a board and when we describe a particle, we have a line that goes up in time. By the way, this image is also it's the last image in Proust. the last page, there is this beautiful sentence which is also true, saying that if he has the time, he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extend in time much longer than in space. If C equal to one, that's very true. So this idea that you have a continuum and time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone is very practical. It's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics. When in the approach of various people including uh Hartle that collaborated a lot with Hawking, there is this idea that what you describe is a history, it's not a particular moment in time, but it's an evolution. This history treats space and time on a more equal basis. But would you say there's more to it than the technical, more to it than the diagrams, more to it than sort of an interpretation of the mathematical equations? Would you go so far as to take solace in the fact that that in a sense that you will always exist because you will always be at the moments of space and time that you have occupied throughout your life? Well, actually that's probably the only way in which you can take solace because all the rest, right? it's all almost children's stuff. I mean, of course it's something that you come by yourself, you arrive at this conclusion which is totally not objective and is part of your personal history by yourself. But it was interesting to see that for instance Kurt Vonnegut had exactly the same take, right? He said, no, I mean, the only thing that really makes you not fear what will happen or your own mortality is that every instant is eternal in some sense exactly as each point in space is eternal space disappears."
