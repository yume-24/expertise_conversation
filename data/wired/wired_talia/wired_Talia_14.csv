45,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so what do you think that thing is",""
46,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","is it some sort of conjecture circuit",""
47,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer",""
48,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","oh wow",""
49,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids",""
50,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","oh wow so when you say cold or you mean like physically colder",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah like physically colder so room temperature is 300 kelvin as you get down all the way to the bottom of the fridge it's at 10 milli kelvin",""
52,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","oh wow",""
53,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah amanda what do you study",""
54,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","so i'm studying computer science currently a sophomore and the track that i'm in is the intelligent systems track machine learning artificial intelligence",""
55,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","you ever heard of quantum computing",""
56,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","from my understanding with a quantum computer rather than using transistors is using spins you can have superposition of spins so different states more combinations means more memory",""
57,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement",""
58,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","i have not",""
59,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference",""
60,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","um not much",""
61,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work",""
62,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","um they read like wave like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out",""
63,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","they create interference so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers",""
65,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","i have no idea",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials",""
67,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","but as like a programmer how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines",""
69,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","so what exactly are some of those problems",""
70,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems",""
71,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","so would it be like in five years or ten years that i would be able to have like one of these sitting in my laptop just in my dorm",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","i don't think you're going to have one in your dorm room anytime soon but you'll have access to one there's three free quantum computers that are all sitting in this lab here that anyone in the world can access through the cloud",""
73,"Speaker 4 (Amanda - College Student)","okay so quantum computing creates new possibilities and new ways to approach problems that classical computers have difficulty doing",""
74,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","couldn't have said it better myself",""
