75,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","so i'm a first year master's student and i'm studying machine learning so it's in the computer science department but it mixes computer science with math and probability and statistics",""
76,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so have you come upon sort of any limits to machine learning",""
77,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","certainly depending on the complexity of your model uh then computational speed is one thing i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right",""
78,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","sure yeah and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing",""
79,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","yeah it's exciting",""
80,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","so in a classical computer you know you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but i guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers",""
81,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right sure you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down sure so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution",""
82,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","so how do we actually uh encode it to start with",""
83,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers okay so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them",""
84,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","how do we measure",""
85,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yes exactly also through microwave signals okay the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic",""
86,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","interesting so what do those algorithms look like",""
87,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question",""
88,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful um factoring those are definitely useful things that i would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one",""
90,"Speaker 5 (Grad Student)","sure how could someone like me who's a grad student get involved in this or what kinds of challenges are you facing that someone like me could help out with",""
91,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out",""
