92,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","i'm a theoretical physicist i started out in condensed matter theory theory that studies superconductors and magnets and i had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas one of the nice things about being a theorist is you get to keep learning new things so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing",""
93,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","my main focus right now is quantum error correction and trying to understand this concept of fault tolerance which everybody thinks they know it when they see it but nobody in the quantum case can precisely define it it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing i was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing he said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable in a quantum system when you look at it or make measurements it it can change in a way that's beyond your control we have the following task build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip","Ambiguous speaker change within this block assumed based on content shift"
94,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","the great power of a quantum computer is also its achilles heel that it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects","Assigned based on content flow"
95,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","you're just multiplying your problems if all you're doing is adding uh exactly","Assigned based on content flow"
96,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information","Assigned based on content flow"
97,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","that's the challenge i would say as much progress as we've made it's a frustration to still be facing it","Assigned based on content flow"
98,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality",""
99,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know",""
100,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah exactly so i think there's going to be a kind of co-evolution of the hardware and the software up here and the sort of middleware and the whole stack",""
101,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","another common myth in the next five years quantum computing will solve climate change cancer [Laughter]",""
102,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","right in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage we're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up it's still very very very early in the development of the field",""
103,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography",""
104,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","there does exist an algorithm shores algorithm which has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer you could find the prime factors of large numbers the basis of the rsa encryption it's the most commonly used thing on the internet first we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute schwarz algorithm on that scale second there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don't use factoring and i don't think anybody has to be concerned at the moment and in the end quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement if you have a quantum communication channel you can encode information and send it through there and it's provably secure based on the laws of physics",""
105,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them",""
106,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","i have no idea what people are going to end up using them for i mean if you had gone back 30 years and handed somebody an iphone they would have called you a wizard so things are going to happen that we just can't foresee",""
107,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","so i hope you enjoyed that foray into the field of quantum computing i know i've personally enjoyed getting to see quantum computing through other people's eyes coming at it from all these different levels this is such an exciting time in the history of quantum computing only in the last couple years have real quantum computers become available to everyone around the world this is the beginning of a many decade adventure where we'll discover so many things about quantum computing and what it will do we don't even know all the amazing things it's going to do and to me that's the most exciting part [Music] you","Final 'you' likely transcription artifact"
