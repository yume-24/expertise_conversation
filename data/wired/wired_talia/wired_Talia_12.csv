1,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","hi my name is talia gershon and i'm a scientist at ibm research today i've been challenged to explain a topic with five levels of increasing complexity it's a completely different kind of computing called quantum computing quantum computers approach solving problems in a fundamentally new way and we hope that by taking this new approach to computation we'll be able to start exploring some problems that we could never solve any other way hopefully by the end of today everyone can leave this discussion understanding quantum computing at some level [Music]",""
2,"Speaker 2 (Child)","what's this",""
3,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah what do you think that is",""
4,"Speaker 2 (Child)","fancy chandelier",""
5,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","i think so too we jokingly call it the chandelier that's real gold you know this is a quantum computer it's a clunt it's a really special kind of computer",""
6,"Speaker 2 (Child)","what does it do",""
7,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","it calculates things but in a totally different way to how your computer calculates things what do you think this is a yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is zero one this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other",""
8,"Speaker 2 (Child)","can computers help you with um your homework your really hard homework",""
9,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people",""
10,"Speaker 2 (Child)","what's your favorite kind of computer",""
11,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","smartphone tablet regular laptop pc i've got to go with my iphone",""
