7,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I was told that maybe science is one of your favorite subjects at school.,
8,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Is that right?,
9,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
10,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Have you actually studied light yet?,
11,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
12,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay what have you learned so far about light?,
13,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),So we learned how to actually light up a light bulb.,
14,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Oh really?,
15,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Oh excellent.,
16,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Well I'm somebody who studies lasers.,
17,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So what do you think about lasers?,
18,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),I don't know--,
19,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You haven't got to play with lasers.,
20,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I brought one.,
21,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),It's my friend's cat toy.,
22,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?,
23,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),No.,
24,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot.",
25,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight.,
26,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I brought a cute little one.,
27,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?",
28,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot.,
29,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"That's true, that laser's just a dot.",
30,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do!",
31,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),But it seems awfully bright doesn't it?,
32,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?",
33,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),The laser.,
34,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),The laser.,
35,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So which one do you think's more powerful?,
36,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),The laser.,
37,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And yet it's not.,
38,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Isn't that amazing?,
39,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
40,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it.",
41,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go.",
42,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You see it actually bending the corner?,
43,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
44,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend.",
45,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair.",
46,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Yeah.,
47,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So this obviously is much bigger than our hair.,
48,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Right?,
49,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
50,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So this is just a demonstration.,
51,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end.",
52,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side.",
53,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You wanna play?,
54,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?,
55,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),I don't have a cat or--,
56,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You don't have a cat.,
57,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So you don't need a cat toy no.,
58,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?,
59,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
60,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?,
61,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes.,
62,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),That's a laser.,
63,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We cut steel with them now.,
64,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We actually do surgery with lasers.,
65,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see?,
66,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We can actually remove those with lasers now.,
67,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Never seen a laser light show?,
68,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks.",
69,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Well I saw a shooting star before.,
70,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Oh you got to see a shooting star?,
71,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there.",
72,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So what do you think about lasers?,
73,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You think they're fun?,
74,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Yes they're very cool.,
75,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),I like the one where you did the green one.,
76,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),The green one.,
77,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And the next time you go to a grocery store, take a peek at the red.",
78,Speaker 2 (Harmoni - Child),Okay.,
79,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
