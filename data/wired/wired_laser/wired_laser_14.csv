156,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So you're a college student?,
157,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),Yes.,
158,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And what's your major?,
159,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math.,
160,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),"I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering.",
161,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Excellent.,
162,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I got an engineering physics degree.,
163,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"There you go, something in common.",
164,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We're here today talking about lasers.,
165,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?,
166,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),Not yet.,
167,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),I'm really hoping that we will.,
168,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics.,
169,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
170,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things?,
171,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening.",
172,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up?",
173,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom.,
174,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so the question really is how do you make that?,
175,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification.",
176,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?,
177,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),Vaguely.,
178,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works.,[Donna pulls out a multi-colored slinky]
179,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Our short pulses are made of different colors.,
180,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I've got a colored slinky here.,
181,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped.,
182,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),The word chirped comes around because birds chirp.,
183,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp.",
184,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse.",[Donna holds the slinky compressed]
185,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate.",
186,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so that was the laser hammer.,
187,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we can't have that in the laser.,
188,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So the question is what could we do?,
189,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material.",
190,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast.",
191,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back.",
192,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so the frequencies go hoo!,
193,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Like this okay?,[Donna stretches the slinky]
194,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse.,
195,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse.",
196,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer.,
197,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom.",
198,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?,
199,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color.",
200,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color.",
201,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time.,
202,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on.,
203,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors.",
204,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra.",
205,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes.",
206,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music.",
207,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now.,
208,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter.,
209,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other.",
210,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"The more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make.",
211,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),What's the pendant?,
212,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize.,
213,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse.,
214,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?",
215,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),"I learned that it all stretches, which is super cool, because red moves the fastest and so it kinda tugs around blue.",
216,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),It really threw me off just how fast.,
217,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),It's hard to imagine things happening that fast.,
218,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),And I also learned how many of the things that I know are lasers.,
219,Speaker 4 (Caitlin - Student),"Like how many of the things that I've been looking for, like, the answers to, it is in lasers.",
