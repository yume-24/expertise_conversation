80,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Today we're here to talk about lasers.,
81,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So what do you think about lasers?,
82,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),I think they're pretty cool.,
83,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),They show up in a lot of my favorite books and movies.,
84,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Like Star Wars or just a bunch of different sci-fi movies and books.,
85,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Do you know anything about lasers?,
86,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),What makes a laser special kind of light.,
87,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),All I really know is from sci-fi books and movies and like the factory cutting lasers that they use to cut steel and stuff.,
88,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Do you even know maybe how to make a laser that it would be strong enough to cut steel?,
89,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),No.,
90,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay. [laughing],
91,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So one of the things about lasers is, if you've ever seen a laser beam, you know it's very directed.",
92,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Like what are they made out of?,
93,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),What is a laser made out of?,
94,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb.,
95,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Right?,
96,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),So it's a beam?,
97,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors.,
98,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special.,
99,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right?,
100,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam.",
101,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"In a laser, it comes out as a single color.",
102,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),They all come out with their waves at the same time.,
103,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power.,
104,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So it can do something like cutting steel.,
105,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light.",
106,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it.",
107,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works.,
108,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail.,
109,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood.",
110,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood.,
111,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in.,
112,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),That's right.,
113,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot.",
114,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area.,
115,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in.",
116,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),See it doesn't really work does it?,
117,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),So the laser needs ultimately many things.,
118,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),"It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--",
119,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Well it depends.,
120,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail.",
121,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible.",
122,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And for that we use a lens.,
123,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel.",
124,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay so that force per unit area--,
125,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),So it's kind of like a magnifying glass?,
126,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Like it magnifies the light down to a point?,
127,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Exactly.,
128,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length.,
129,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light.",
130,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Exactly.,
131,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.",
132,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"It's 300,000 kilometers long.",
133,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated.",
134,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper.,
135,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them.",
136,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red.",
137,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?,
138,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Exactly.,
139,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with.",
140,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--",
141,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),It funnels into--,
142,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Into a spot.,
143,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down.",
144,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Hit a lens and it would have to focus down.,
145,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much.",
146,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Eventually it would be here, more concentrated.",
147,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer.",
148,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks those electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away.",
149,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?,
150,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),"Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles.",
151,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color.,
152,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way.,
153,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?,
154,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Of course I'm gonna have to share something about my experience.,
155,Speaker 3 (Eli Kaplan - Teenager),Learning about lasers with an expert like you.,
