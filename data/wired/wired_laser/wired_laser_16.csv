292,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Hello Donna, good to see you.",
293,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me.",
294,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we go way back.,
295,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"1991, the year I got married,",
296,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey,",
297,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),to work with you in Livermore.,
298,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),I remember very much and how hard it was,
299,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),to convince you to travel across the country,
300,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and work at the lab.,
301,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And stay there.,
302,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And stay there.,
303,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),[laughing],
304,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),I couldn't convince you to stay.,
305,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"You could not convince me to stay, no.",
306,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),But you were there long enough to make a big impression,
307,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and get some good work done.,
308,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And I've been talking sort of,",
309,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),started with sort of what is a laser,
310,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"through linear optics, non linear optics,",
311,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know,",
312,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit,
313,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter.,
314,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23,
315,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I think at this point.,
316,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),But even if we get to 100 petawatts,
317,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"and focus that down to a wavelength,",
318,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),we're not at 10 to the 29.,
319,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So you're hoping to build the biggest laser.,
320,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Yes.,
321,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),At Rochester.,
322,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit,",
323,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),isn't that right?,
324,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So just a little bit of back history again.,
325,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"After you demonstrated CPA, I was intrigued by",
326,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),how powerful could we make lasers?,
327,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And then how lasers are wonderful,
328,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),because they allow you to take energy,
329,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and compress it in space and time.,
330,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"So having high P power is something,",[P = Peak power]
331,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),it's been a motivator for me for a long time.,
332,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And so we at the university are making proposals,
333,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"to build two 25 petawatt lasers, maybe 30 petawatt lasers.",
334,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),We'll use them to be able to get combined power,
335,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),of over 10 to the 24 watts per square center.,
336,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Still far from the Schwinger limit.,
337,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),But we have a trick.,
338,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),We're going to use one of these petawatt lasers,
339,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),to make an electron beam.,
340,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And this electron beam will be relativistic.,
341,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"We actually think we could make electron beam,",
342,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"maybe even 100s of GeV up to TeV,",[GeV = Gigaelectronvolt; TeV = Teraelectronvolt]
343,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),which would be another Nobel Prize if we did that.,
344,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"That's right, if you can do that, go for it.",
345,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam,",
346,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit.",
347,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Okay, but that's kind of cheating.",
348,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),That's not getting to 10 to the 29.,
349,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),If you could do it with 100% efficiency,
350,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),that's all we need.,
351,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),That's why I wanna cheat.,
352,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),That's the Nobel Prize winning idea though,
353,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),if we can come up with it.,
354,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Because again, if we're able to do this,",
355,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),with ways I can see today.,
356,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Right?,
357,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"I can see us doing it today,",
358,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),by just exploiting what we already know,
359,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"and taking it to a limit,",
360,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"then that would be a real motivator, I think,",
361,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),to be able to even take these techniques further.,
362,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Cheating's not the right exact word,
363,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),as taking advantage of relativity.,
364,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Take advantage of all physics not just optical physics.,
365,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So that's why we wanna do it this way.,
366,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We have to get into entertainment.,
367,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),When is the high intensity laser gonna,
368,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),get into entertainment so then there's real money?,
369,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Yes, yes, well we have Star Trek,",
370,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),we had the photon torpedoes.,
371,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"I always thought they actually knew what you were doing,",
372,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),there's a photon torpedo.,
373,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Have you ever seen that in--,
374,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),No.,
375,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Oh.,
376,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I don't like science fiction.,
377,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Oh no, Star Trek had photon torpedoes",
378,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and they showed bursts of light about this long.,
379,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"It was a CPA, it was a few nanosecond pulse.",
380,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Didn't say how much energy it carried,",
381,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and you could see it.,
382,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),I don't know what it was gathering off of,
383,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"but you could see it, so it was a great thing.",
384,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating,
385,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),and going into that rest frame.,
386,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Yes.,
387,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit,",
388,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"we're not up to that kind of acceleration,",
389,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea.,
390,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Absolutely.,
391,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Or we need, going around and giving my talks now,",
392,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),I show how we're plateauing.,
393,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up,",
394,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),but we're sort of starting to plateau again,
395,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea.,
396,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so do you think it's on the horizon?,
397,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Do you see anything out there that really says,",
398,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),oh yeah that's a good way to go?,
399,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right?,
400,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We can't stay in the visual.,
401,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So actually there's a potential ways,
402,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),of doing it with optical or near optical radiation.,
403,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And there's been a lot of work done in the defense,
404,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?",
405,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
406,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And make them act as one coherent source.,
407,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So one of the things that we'll be doing,
408,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"with our two petawatts, we're going to see",
409,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),if we can actually combine them into a 50.,
410,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"If you can do that, you can begin",
411,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),to imagine doing this with many lasers.,
412,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about.,
413,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So one could possibly see an exawatt from that.,
414,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together,
415,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),for a coherent source so you have to be able,
416,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"to phase lock them, you have to be able to make",
417,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),their phases be exactly connected,
418,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"and related and be able, as they propagate through all",
419,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"the different optical components, whatever it may be--",
420,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And right across the beam.,
421,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge?,
422,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),'Cos it's not like our beams are,
423,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),as perfect as we like to think they are.,
424,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"So that's right so you have to have the aperture size,",
425,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),you have to have them phase,
426,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),locked across the entire aperture.,
427,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Which will be a great challenge,
428,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"and people have done it, again, with small lasers.",
429,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture.,
430,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So we'll begin to start looking at this.,
431,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And actually wavelength control and then be able,
432,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),to adaptive optics other ways which,
433,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),you can control the uniformity of the phase,
434,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),is something that's been developed in lots of ways now.,
435,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"For defense applications, for science applications.",
436,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),So we will do our best to,
437,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),make use of all these technologies.,
438,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Lasers I think have progressed so much.,
439,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market",
440,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"for it, there were so many different applications for that.",
441,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay so there's a lot of us working around,
442,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"the world on these high intensity lasers and so,",
443,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),what do you think the real fun is?,
444,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),What do you see the real excitement being?,
445,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),I remember when,
446,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"laser was first demonstrated 1960,",
447,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),what could we do with this?,
448,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),We already got light.,
449,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Now we can't live without lasers.,
450,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"My cell phone, that is in my",
451,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"pocket, has billions of transistors.",
452,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),How is that made?,
453,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),With lasers.,
454,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers.,
455,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),"Actually now it's using x-rays,",
456,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),made from laser heated matter.,
457,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),That came out of the laser fusion program.,
458,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So it is amazing, the parallels.",
459,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And optics is used everywhere.,
460,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"We're gonna possibly take over from CERN,",
461,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"we'll just do high energy physics with lasers,",
462,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"we're looking at gravity waves with lasers,",
463,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"we wanna do black holes with lasers,",
464,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"we wanna machine with lasers,",
465,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),we wanna do medicine with lasers.,
466,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),It's everywhere.,
467,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing",
468,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),more about it so they know lasers are everywhere.,
469,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),I couldn't agree with you more,
470,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and you winning the Nobel prize has,
471,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),been an inspiration to lots of people.,
472,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),Only three women have won the Nobel prize in physics,
473,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),and only one educated in the United States.,
474,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),You.,
475,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),There you go.,
476,Speaker 6 (Mike Campbell),And I use that every place.,
477,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
478,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And only one Canadian.,
479,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),There you go!,
