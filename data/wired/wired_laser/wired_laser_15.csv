220,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So I understand you're in grad school.,
221,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Where?,
222,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),At NYU.,
223,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And what are you studying?,
224,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"I'm studying soft matter physics,",
225,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),which involves the physics of squishy stuff.,
226,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),We make microswimmers in the laboratory,
227,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),and we drive them with a laser.,
228,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And what kind of laser do you use?,
229,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"We use a 10 watt laser, it's a fiber laser.",
230,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Do you know a lot about lasers?,
231,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Or just about the laser that you use.,
232,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"Not a lot, just a little bit.",
233,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
234,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So this is about high intensity lasers.,
235,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Not only how do you make them,",
236,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics.,
237,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application,",
238,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification,",
239,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"so that we could stretch the pulse,",
240,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"safely amplify it, then compress it at the end,",
241,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end.,
242,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?,
243,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate,",
244,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification.",
245,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time.,
246,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison.,
247,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up,",
248,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?,
249,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"I have, yeah.",
250,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution.,
251,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?,
252,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"No, I haven't worked with that.",
253,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),You haven't?,
254,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Okay.,
255,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?",
256,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12,",
257,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field.,
258,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse.,
259,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt.,
260,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond,",
261,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab.,
262,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter.",
263,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter?",
264,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we still have six orders.,
265,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23.,
266,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So we've done 11 orders,",
267,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),so you think six isn't so much harder.,
268,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over.",
269,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),We need another Nobel Prize winning idea.,
270,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity,",
271,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum.,
272,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot.",
273,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body.,
274,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Yes.,
275,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell?",
276,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Or to ionize it?,
277,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell,",
278,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),like a tumor cell or something like that.,
279,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns.,
280,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field,",
281,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility.,
282,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"So after hearing about high intensity lasers,",
283,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),"can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers,",
284,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),can you see how short pulses might help you?,
285,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave,",
286,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much,
287,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer.,
288,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),That's true.,
289,Speaker 1 (Donna Strickland),Thank you very much.,
290,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),"Thank you, Donna.",
291,Speaker 5 (Aditya - Grad Student),It was really nice to meet you.,
