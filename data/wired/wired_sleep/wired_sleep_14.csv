100,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So tell me, where are you in school? What do you study?",""
101,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'm a fourth year Chemistry student at USF.",""
102,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So pretty science-y.",""
103,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Yes, pretty science-y.",""
104,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Excellent, because today for this level, we're talking about sleep.",""
105,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Great.",""
106,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","How much sleep do you get, typically?",""
107,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","During the summer? Like 10 hours.",""
108,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","10 hours?",""
109,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","And during the school year, maybe five?",""
110,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Wow.",""
111,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Yeah.",""
112,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And so, how much do you think you need?",""
113,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range.",""
114,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult. So at least seven hours.",""
115,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less. What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?",""
116,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep.",""
117,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Right. You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly. Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep.",""
118,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names. Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right?",""
119,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things. It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping.",""
120,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days. We have early sunrises, late sunsets. Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?",""
121,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm.",""
122,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep. One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive. Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get. You stay up, you get sleepy. Time goes by, you get sleepier.",""
123,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay? So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat. You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness. But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up.",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right? And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again. And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you.",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, to where you feel sleepy, right?",""
126,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Right.",""
127,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","What did you learn about sleep today?",""
128,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I learned about the two processes, process S and process C. I learned about the circadian rhythm, and it doesn't only rely on melatonin, but it also relies on your eating and a whole bunch of other factors that affect your circadian rhythm.",""
