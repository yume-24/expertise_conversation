1,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","My name's Aric Prather and I'm a sleep scientist at UCSF. I study the causes and consequences of insufficient sleep, and I also carry out interventions to improve sleep among people with insomnia. Today, I've been challenged to explain the topic of sleep at five different levels. Everybody knows a little bit about what is happening when they sleep, but I think they'll be surprised that there's a lot of science in there.","Intro"
2,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Nice to meet you, my name's Christopher.",""
3,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Hey Christopher. And how old are you?",""
4,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","I'm ten.",""
5,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","What grade is that?",""
6,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","I think fifth.",""
7,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","You think fifth? What is your favorite subject?",""
8,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Math and science.",""
9,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Well that's awesome, because we're going to be talking about science today.",""
10,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Cool.",""
11,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And you know what we're going to be talking about?",""
12,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","What?",""
13,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Sleep.",""
14,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Favorite part of the day.",""
15,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it. Because you know what sleep does for you?",""
16,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","It rests your body, like an electric car.",""
17,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","[laughs] That's exactly right. It kinda is like recharging your battery, right? And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right? It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before. It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy.",""
18,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Whoa.",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep. So here's the first one. What's that?",""
20,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","A giraffe.",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Have you ever seen a giraffe in person?",""
22,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Uh yeah.",""
23,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","They're pretty cool, right?",""
24,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Mhm.",""
25,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes!",""
26,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer. It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing. It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time.",""
27,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","And how does it like recharge, like humans?",""
28,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently. And so we're still really learning about how this works. Sleep science itself is kind of a new field.",""
29,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","I had a sleepover on Saturday, and I didn't sleep at all.",""
30,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And how did you feel?",""
31,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Really tired.",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Really tired. Do you think you were a little crankier than usual?",""
33,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Yeah.",""
34,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right? What do you think happens if you don't sleep?",""
35,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","It affects what you can do in your daily life.",""
36,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Excellent. So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay? So we have this one. What's that?",""
37,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","A hippo.",""
38,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","A hippopotamus. They have a different challenge. They sleep underwater.",""
39,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","I could never do that, I would pass out.",""
40,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Right, right! So how do they do it? In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right? And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it?",""
41,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So it's really fascinating. What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up. They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need. It's a really amazing thing. What do you think?",""
42,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","That's cool.",""
43,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Would it be cool to have that power?",""
44,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Uh yeah.",""
45,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all. Okay, so what's this?",""
46,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Aww a dolphin.",""
47,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","A dolphin! Yes. So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay? But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe. Dolphins breathe air. They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right?",""
48,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right? You know how dolphins sleep?",""
49,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","How?",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","One half of their brain at a time. So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time. So like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe. Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive. Is that amazing or what?","[Image showing Unihemispheric sleep] "
51,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","That's cool.",""
52,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So what'd you learn today?",""
53,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","I learned how other animals sleep.",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","What is important about sleeping?",""
55,"Speaker 2 (Christopher)","Sleep rests your body, and you have to rest your body in order to do your daily things in life.",""
