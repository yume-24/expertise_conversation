129,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Hi, I'm Aric.",""
130,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","Mave.",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Thank you for joining us. What do you do? Where are you at in school?",""
132,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","So I'm at UC Berkeley, I'm a psychology student studying cognitive neuro-science and I just started my third year.",""
133,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Congratulations.",""
134,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","Thank you.",""
135,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So a lot of brain stuff.",""
136,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","A lot of brain stuff.",""
137,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum.",""
138,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","I study the cerebellum too!",""
139,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition.",""
140,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","Great.",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay? So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all or nothing experience.",""
142,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right? So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes.",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system. It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain.",""
144,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic—so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus.",""
145,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain. So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right?",""
146,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day.",""
147,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep? How reliable are those kinds of interventions?",""
148,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right? And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep.",""
149,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected? You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?",""
150,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","You know, so I think that's less clear. In some ways, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO.",""
151,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","And that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones. And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing.","[Image showing VLPO neurons inhibiting the Locus Coeruleus and Raphe Nuclei]"
152,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep? Have you asked them about their sleep?",""
153,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","Well in most studies, probably it is advised for your participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep, so those would be recommendations that you would lay out, you know, in communication with the participant, before they come in.",""
154,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is. That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain.",""
155,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","I often think that people, many people think that they can get by on very little sleep where the less than average amount of sleep, from what I know from the research, you know if you actually test those people on different batteries of cognitive tasks, you often find that their performance is slightly worse than they had anticipated.",""
156,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","Yeah. So what did you learn about sleep today?",""
157,"Speaker 5 (Mave)","I guess I learned a system that is, you know, very heavily regulated and influenced by some of these older conserved sub-cortical systems in the brain, and that there's, as you called it, like a flip flop function between wakefulness and sleep that's regulated by these specific dopaminergic, noradrenergic, like neurotransmitters, that manifest in different sub-cortical parts of the brain.",""
158,"Speaker 1 (Aric Prather)","So now we have sleep on your brain. That was all I wanted to hear.",""
