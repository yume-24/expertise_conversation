117,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So today we'll talk a bit about robotics and machine learning and artificial intelligence.",""
118,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So have you heard of Moravec's paradox?",""
119,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I haven't heard of Moravec's paradox?",""
120,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah.",""
121,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","That's what it's called.",""
122,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah.",""
123,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","yeah, I haven't heard of it before.",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It describes something in AI, which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans, are actually really difficult to build into AI systems.",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And on the flip side, picking up an object, really simple for people, but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems.",""
126,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems?",""
127,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Yeah, I did work with robots, but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff.",""
128,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","We were just sending like instructions and the robot would do, like, perform like a simple task.",""
129,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I wasn't so used to the aspect of, like, teaching computer how to do stuff.",""
130,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions, more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it.",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And how would you just describe machine learning, like in one sentence?",""
132,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I'd say machine learning is giving like feeding data to a program or to a machine and they start to learn based off of that data.",""
133,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting, if you were to apply machine learning to robots?",""
134,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I think of like coordinates.",""
135,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah, exactly.",""
136,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","One thing that my research has been looking into is, if we can have robots learn from data, we'll collect data from the robot sensors.",""
137,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And if the robot has sensors in its arm, to figure out the angle of one of its wrist, for example, then we'll record that angle.",""
138,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And all of the robots experience will go into a data set, that if we wanted a robot to solve a task, like, I don't know, picking up a cup, and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup, if it only had the data of picking up the first cup, do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup?",""
139,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I don't think so.",""
140,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","I feel like that might be a problem.",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah, so there's this generalization gap, this gap between what it was trained to do and the new thing.",""
142,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","So what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn, is it motion?",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So you can think of robotics as having two core components.",""
144,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","One is perception, being able to see and feel and so forth, and action, where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm.",""
145,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And both components are really essential, and both components are quite difficult.",""
146,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","If you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions, then it might make errors in a way that mess up the system that selects actions.",""
147,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And so if you instead try to train these two systems together, to have it learn perception action for the goal of solving these different tasks, then the robot can be more successful.",""
148,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","One thing that's really difficult about robotics is, there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world.",""
149,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","On the internet, there's all sorts of text data, all sorts of image data that people upload and write.",""
150,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","But there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing, like tying your shoe, for example, because it's so basic.",""
151,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","One challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks.",""
152,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data?",""
153,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Or do you think, is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets?",""
154,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","Is that what's keeping us behind?",""
155,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","That's a great question.",""
156,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own.",""
157,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And by doing that, we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of Moravec's paradox.",""
158,"Speaker 4 (College Student)","What are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning?",""
159,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Deep learning is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges, because it allows us to leverage large data sets.",""
160,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And so, deep learning is basically, corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks.",""
161,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning.",""
162,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","A third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms.",""
163,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task, but leverage experience from other task in the past.",""
164,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And they're not just completely separate.",""
165,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them.",""
