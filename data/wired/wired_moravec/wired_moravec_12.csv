7,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Hi, I'm Chelsea, what's your name?",""
8,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Juliette.",""
9,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Nice to meet you, Juliette.",""
10,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Today, we'll talk a little bit about a concept called Moravec's paradox.",""
11,"Speaker 2 (Child)","What's that?",""
12,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot.",""
13,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Something like stacking these two cups.",""
14,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Do you think that's easy or hard?",""
15,"Speaker 2 (Child)","If it's this way, then it's easy, but if it's this way, you need to balance it or, oh-",""
16,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It's still pretty easy, right?",""
17,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It turns out that stacking these two cups, it's actually really hard for robots to do that.",""
18,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So, let's think about how we might have a robot stack these two cups.",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","You could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup.",""
20,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Okay.",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And then program the robot to move over here and open the-",""
22,"Speaker 2 (Child)","And drop it.",""
23,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Exactly, right?",""
24,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","That seemed pretty simple for the robot to do.",""
25,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Say we even just move the cup over here.",""
26,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups?",""
27,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yes.",""
28,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We can see what happens.",""
29,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So it's gonna, we programed the robot to move to the same exact position as before.",""
30,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Oh yeah.",""
31,"Speaker 2 (Child)","So it goes to the same place.",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","When we gave it instructions, did we tell it to look at where the cup was?",""
33,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Or did we tell it to just move over here?",""
34,"Speaker 2 (Child)","We told it to just move over here.",""
35,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Exactly.",""
36,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So, Moravec's paradox is something that means that these really simple things, like stacking cups, is really, really hard for robots, even though it's really easy for us.",""
37,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","While robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things.",""
38,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together.",""
39,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Okay.",""
40,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Does that seem like a hard task or an easy task?",""
41,"Speaker 2 (Child)","It's easy for me.",""
42,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","You're good at multiplying big numbers together?",""
43,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yes.",""
44,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Could you multiply 4,100 by-",""
45,"Speaker 2 (Child)","No, I can't do that.",""
46,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","But it's actually really easy for a computer to do that.",""
47,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So how fast were you able to stack the two cups?",""
48,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Like two seconds.",""
49,"Speaker 2 (Child)","It took me like a couple days when I learned how to stack cups.",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah.",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","But so it took you a couple days when you learned how to stack cups, but before that, you already knew how to grasp objects, right?",""
52,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","You already knew how to pick up cups.",""
53,"Speaker 2 (Child)","Yeah.",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And so you could use that when you were learning to stack cups.",""
55,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We're trying to be inspired by how humans learn to do tasks, to allow robots to do the same kind of things that are very simple for people, like stacking cups.",""
56,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We want robots to be able to do something like that too.",""
