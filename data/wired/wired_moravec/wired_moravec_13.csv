58,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","What grade are you in?",""
59,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","I am about to be a junior.",""
60,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Have you heard of something called Moravec's paradox?",""
61,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Never heard of it.",""
62,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Typically you would think that things that are easy for humans, are also easy for robots and computers to do.",""
63,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Right.",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do.",""
65,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","But it turns out that it's actually the opposite.",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","I wanna try a little demo.",""
67,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Okay.",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand.",""
69,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So that was pretty easy, right?",""
70,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
71,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We're gonna make this a little bit harder now.",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So, can you put these on?",""
73,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed.",""
74,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","There you go.",""
75,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Let's try that one more time, and see if you can do any better.",""
76,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So close your eyes.",""
77,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Oh, there we go.",""
78,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah.",""
79,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So that you're able, with a bit more practice, you're able to figure it out.",""
80,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","When it fell on the ground, how did you know to pick it up off the ground?",""
81,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","From the sound.",""
82,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So when a robot tries to do something, like pick up an object, not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do, the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is.",""
83,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Then this is what's called a perception action loop in robotics.",""
84,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So if the object moves, the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object.",""
85,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It's really important for robots to be able to leverage, not just like the past hour of experience, but also ideally many years of experience, in order to do the kinds of things that you did.",""
86,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","It's kind of hard for me to understand why like robots can do like all these crazy calculations, but they can't do like all the simple stuff, so.",""
87,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Yeah.",""
88,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It's really unintuitive.",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","In order to survive, we need to pick up objects and everything.",""
90,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Basically many, many, like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that.",""
91,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So, it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general.",""
92,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","So do robots know, like, they messed up? They know.",""
93,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","That's a great question.",""
94,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So in reinforcement learning, the robot tries the task, and then it gets some sort of reinforcement, some sort of feedback.",""
95,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It's similar to how you might train a dog.",""
96,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
97,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So you could give it feedback like that.",""
98,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So it won't necessarily know itself, especially on the first few tries, but it's trying to figure out what the task is even.",""
99,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Does a robot see like how we see or does it like, just see like a program or something?",""
100,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","We give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers.",""
101,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Basically, each pixel has three different numbers, one for R, for G and for B.",""
102,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers.",""
103,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","And it has to be able to figure out, from that massive set of numbers, what is in the world.",""
104,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","There is a number of different ways to have the robot see, but we use a technique called neural networks, that tries to take out in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world, and where those objects are.",""
105,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Can a robot ever go off the program?",""
106,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It depends on how you program the robot.",""
107,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","If you program the robot to follow exact motions and follow a very specific program, then it won't go off that program.",""
108,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","It will always do those actions.",""
109,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","But if something unexpected happens, that the program wasn't designed to handle, then the robot might go off court.",""
110,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Do you think robots will take over the world? Just being honest.",""
111,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","I think that robotics is really, really hard.",""
112,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","Having robots do even really basic stuff, like pick up objects, is really, really hard.",""
113,"Speaker 1 (Chelsea Finn)","So if they do take over the world, I think it'll be a very, very, very, very long time from now.",""
114,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Very long time.",""
115,"Speaker 3 (Teen)","Yeah.",""
