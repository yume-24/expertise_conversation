Sequence,Speaker,Utterance,Notes
1,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","I’m a theoretical physicist... Steve, tell me about your research and the work you’ve been doing in quantum computing.",""
2,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","My main focus right now is quantum error correction and trying to understand this concept of fault tolerance... It's something that we've already figured out for classical computing... build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts. Common myth: how many qubits do you have? That’s the only thing that matters... like just add more qubits. What's the big deal?",""
3,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","The great power of a quantum computer is also its Achilles' heel—it's very, very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects.",""
4,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","You're just multiplying your problems if all you're doing is adding [qubits]... exactly.",""
5,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","I think something that frustrates a lot of people... is the concept of decoherence. You can only keep your information quantum for so long, and that limits how many operations you can do in a row.",""
6,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","That's the challenge... as much progress as we've made, it's a frustration to still be facing it.",""
7,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","Let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault-tolerant quantum computers.",""
8,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","There are so many things... we need to build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level.",""
9,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","Yeah exactly, so I think there’s going to be a kind of co-evolution of the hardware and the software... and the whole stack.",""
10,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","Another common myth: in the next five years, quantum computing will solve climate change or cancer.",""
11,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","Right, people really have to understand that we’re either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage—we’re trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up.",""
12,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","One last myth: quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption.",""
13,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","There does exist an algorithm—Shor's algorithm—which has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer, you could find the prime factors of large numbers... [But] we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor's algorithm on that scale. Second, there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don’t use factoring... and in the end, quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement... it's provably secure based on the laws of physics.",""
14,"Speaker 1 (Talia Gershon)","Now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud... what do you think people want to do with them?",""
15,"Speaker 6 (Steve - Expert/Physicist)","I have no idea... if you had gone back 30 years and handed somebody an iPhone, they would have called you a wizard. So things are going to happen that we just can't foresee.",""
