102,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so what have you heard about Fusion already before today",""
103,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","the impeding joke is that you know we've looked forward to Fusion for a long time but you're not exactly gone in there yet but if we do ever get",""
104,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","there it would solve a lot of our energy problems in a dramatic way",""
105,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","do you have any idea about any of the challenges like why has it taken us so long to get to Fusion",""
106,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","making a star honor at this thought easy",""
107,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so we are trying to bring a starter works we are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system our sun uses hydrogen to make helium and generates Fusion Energy",""
108,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","that way instead on Earth we're going to be using isotopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium what do you know",""
109,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","about charged particles if I want to try and push too positively charge particles together two protons together what do",""
110,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","you think is going to happen they repulse each other and they don't like being close together so they push",""
111,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","back on that we're gonna call the pushback is a coulomb interaction or coulomb Collision so you can sort of",""
112,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a Triton and so those are the positively charged ions of",""
113,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","deuterium and tritium and I try and combine them together those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off",""
114,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","of each other so we have to give them enormous amounts of energy and it has to do with getting",""
115,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","up to very high temperatures so we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius and we typically put that into",""
116,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron volt and so we describe being",""
117,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts that's very very hot temperature but the",""
118,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","other thing we need is a lot of particles that's the density we are able to combine a deuteron and",""
119,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","a Triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures at lower energies than other fuel this has to do with",""
120,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","some very nice properties of the deuteron and the Triton that when we get them close enough to one another",""
121,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","to fuse there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics and that really helps have a little bump",""
122,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","up in the cross section for the deuterium tritium fusion reaction compared to just hydrogen",""
123,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","yes exactly exactly",""
124,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","how that little bump up is good for us because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium",""
125,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures and when we say manageable for Fusion scientists yeah",""
126,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","50 million 100 million 150 million Celsius",""
127,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","so the problem you described is that we get to those high temperatures we have dense plasma but the problem is the hotter the plasma is the more likely it is the heat",""
128,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","to get sucked out of it",""
129,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","by absolutely yeah absolutely glad that solved is not saying staying hot enough for",""
130,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","the time we needed to stay we've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas which is which",""
131,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","is what I work on that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause",""
132,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","loss of the plasma so you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion",""
133,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","reaction so we've got the deuteron and we've got the Triton and so they combine in an effusion reaction and that",""
134,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","produces a neutron and a helium nucleus",""
135,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","but the neutron doesn't have any charge",""
136,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yes it comes out exactly so it comes right out and it's the kinetic energy of the neutron and we want it to interact with our",""
137,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","overall Energy System and as it interacts with that material it heats the material up it transfers its kinetic",""
138,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","energy to this material take that thermal energy and run a turbine run a generator and convert it into electricity",""
139,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so once you get to that stage it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant whether",""
140,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","it's fission or natural gas so a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in setting it in",""
141,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","place and driving your thermal system to make electricity",""
142,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","we often call it an alpha particle and that is a charged particle right",""
143,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so it's actually going to stay in the plasma it's an energetic particle compared to the fuel so it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via coulomb collisions",""
144,"Speaker 4 (Undergrad Student)","cool so now they're good now we like them so you get this kind of self-sustaining it's like",""
145,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yes you said exactly the right word self-sustaining",""
