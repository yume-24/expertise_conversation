Sequence,Speaker,Utterance,Notes
1,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","my name is Anne White I'm a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT and I've been challenged today",""
2,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","to explain nuclear fusion in five levels of increasing difficulty Fusion is so exciting because it is extraordinarily beautiful physics",""
3,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","which underpins some of the most basic processes in our universe nuclear processes has a tremendously valuable application for humankind",""
4,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","a virtually Limitless Clean safe carbon-free form of energy",""
5,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","what's your name tell me a little bit about yourself",""
6,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","I'm Amelia I'm nine years old I'm a third grade",""
7,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","and my favorite subject at school is definitely science so my son is five years old and he asked me",""
8,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","what kind of science I do and I said fusion and I said I put a star in a jar",""
9,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","does that make sense okay that's a good answer because it sounds a little ridiculous right how can we put",""
10,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","a star in a jar well we're not actually going to put the sun which is a star inside a",""
11,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","jar but instead we're going to take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of and",""
12,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container so Fusion is about bringing",""
13,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","things together that's what fusing means when those Fusion reactions occur a new particle is created and energy is also",""
14,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","released do you know what an atom is",""
15,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yeah",""
16,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","all right so Adam is what everything in our world is made of and at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus and inside that nucleus",""
17,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","is a proton we want to take those those protons and push them together to make them combine and release",""
18,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","energy Fusion Energy that we can use to make electricity and there's a lot of different energies and forces that",""
19,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","we have to think about have you heard of gravity",""
20,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes yes",""
21,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","okay so that is a big important fundamental Force so another fun Force to talk about that's important for Fusion you're familiar with electricity",""
22,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes right",""
23,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and so there's also electric forces electrostatic forces and you've heard of static electricity so now let's see about static electricity lifting",""
24,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","my hair up I can move there's a white strand it's like hanging down the balloon took on the force",""
25,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","from like your hair and put it in here now just like move it there you go",""
26,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yeah and so if we want to take those those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy Fusion",""
27,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","Energy that we can use to make electricity then we have to actually overcome that strong electrostatic force that just",""
28,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","want to make those balls bounce off of each other there's another Force which you might be familiar with which",""
29,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","is like a magnetic force",""
30,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","we're just learning about our teacher Shield is putting one magnet on and then flipping",""
31,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","the other one around it made it the top like kind of Bounce",""
32,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yeah so thinking on how to do that you know scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works right it'll still be there for you to tackle",""
33,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","when you become a scientist have you ever seen one of these games",""
34,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes with the iron filing",""
35,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so if you take this and you take the magnetic end maybe you can show us what's going to happen with it",""
36,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","while you move around those iron filings with the magnet you're totally in control of that material you're pushing you're",""
37,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","pulling it you're moving it around and so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you",""
38,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","have you learned about the states of matter",""
39,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes tell me about that so great and she put a picture",""
40,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","on the board should you say tomorrow she shows a picture of ice a picture of water and a picture",""
41,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","of gas",""
42,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","did you learn that there's also a fourth state of matter",""
43,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","no",""
44,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","when you heat up a gas you create a plasma a plasma is the fourth state of matter the plasma I study is actually invisible I",""
45,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","think we heard science",""
46,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes",""
47,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and the plasmas I work with are so hot that I can't see with my eyes but it's light that I can measure it with very very special instruments let's",""
48,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","play music how do you keep the invisible plasmas",""
49,"Speaker 2 (Amelia - Child)","yes or invisibility keep them in one spot so you can show where they are",""
50,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yes we absolutely do we hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields so you",""
51,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","didn't have to actually touch the iron filings in the toy to move them around you could pass the magnetic",""
52,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","field through the plastic and control them with it so it's the same thing we don't have to touch this",""
53,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","very very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields you are so",""
54,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","smart I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject",""
