55,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","what is fusion energy",""
56,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","the way our sun generates energy is by Fusion reactions it fuses hydrogen the lightest element",""
57,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","we know about into helium and that gets fused into heavier and heavier elements so here on Earth we're going",""
58,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","to take some special kinds of hydrogen a special flavor of it if you will which we call an isotope",""
59,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and we're going to combine them to create new particles and we can only get that combination of particles to",""
60,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","happen if they are in a plasma what's your favorite exhibit the science museum",""
61,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","I love the lightning show like",""
62,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","okay so cool you probably have learned in school about three states of matter the solid liquid and gas absolutely",""
63,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","we take the gas and we add heat and we get a plasma and a plasma is a state of",""
64,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","matter where you have an ionized gas if we break down that gas if we add enough energy to ionize",""
65,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","it we can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them and now there's this soup",""
66,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","of charged particles that are moving around that's the plasma and it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning",""
67,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so you've already seen a plasma in fact so I'm going to show you this fun demonstration you've probably seen",""
68,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","one of these before right",""
69,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","oh that's so cool",""
70,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yeah so the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma and we've taken most of the air out of the container so there's",""
71,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","not a lot of particles inside the glass ball and very very low temperature plasma so it's continuously ionizing and",""
72,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","then recombining and becoming neutral again and we see those energy transitions as the visible light so if we're going",""
73,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","to put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it like maybe make some clean electricity we would",""
74,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","have to control it",""
75,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","yeah and another word for controlling it is confining it so let me let me turn",""
76,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","this off and set it back down you probably wondering what is this thing on this table it's a model",""
77,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","of a Tokamak and that's the name of the device that I work on with the goal of creating clean",""
78,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","energy have you played with magnets in school",""
79,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","okay we've learned about the how it has to be a positive positive and negative charge and we've done those things you can like put them with something in between them and just move one and the other will always follow",""
80,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","this is all very important to sort of understand how we would create a container that would let us hold the plasma in place and control it have you ever played",""
81,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","around with an electromagnet in class it's a coil of wire much like this big red coil of wire right",""
82,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","here and when we push an electrical current through this wire it creates a magnetic field that goes around the",""
83,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","wire perpendicular so if you want to know the direction of the magnetic field that's been created by pushing the",""
84,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","current Through the Wire put your thumb in the direction of the current and then curl your fingers like this",""
85,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","yeah and that's the right hand rule",""
86,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","so if we push the current this way we're creating a magnetic field in this perpendicular Direction so if I drive a current and this red wire like this which direction will the",""
87,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","magnetic field go",""
88,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","yeah exactly perpendicular",""
89,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and if I drive the current in this green wire which direction will it go",""
90,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","exactly yeah the Long Way perpendicular",""
91,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","now this is a bit of a trickier one the blue wire is going to act like a transformer action and so by changing the current in the blue coil we are going",""
92,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","to be able to run a current in this direction around the Tokamak and now think back to how the",""
93,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","wires worked if I have a current going like this where's the magnetic field",""
94,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","exactly back this way the short way around the tokoak",""
95,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","we can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our Tokamak so our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a",""
96,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","donut",""
97,"Speaker 3 (High School Student)","what could the tocamak be used for in like real life",""
98,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","oh Supple address so what we want to use the Toca mic for in realize is to confine this super hot plasma and we're talking a hundred million",""
99,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","150 million degrees because the plasma is so very hot the particles have enough energy to interact with one another",""
100,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","and fuse when those Fusion reactions occur we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus and we can harness that",""
101,"Speaker 1 (Anne White)","energy to make clean electricity",""
