25,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Do you know what crisper is?,
26,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),Absolutely not.,
27,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),"No, not at all.",
28,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Crisper is a way to edit the genome.,
29,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Do you know what a genome is?,
30,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),"Yeah, it's the DNA.",
31,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),DNA is kind of um the language that the genome is written in.,
32,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And the genome itself is,
33,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"is an instruction manual that describes how to make you,",
34,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"how tall you should be, what color hair you have, or what color eyes you have.",
35,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So what crisper is and an easy way to think about it,",
36,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),it's like a molecular pair of scissors,
37,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"that can go through that long, long genome and find specific places,",
38,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),make small cuts and edit it.,
39,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),What do you think about being able to edit genomes?,
40,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),It's actually kind of cool cuz then you could change,
41,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),can't you technically change things about a person if you edit the DNA?,
42,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Sure.,
43,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So how do we determine what's what's the right uses then?,
44,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),I don't think it should be used for almost,
45,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),"cosmetology reasons or like for people just to be like,",
46,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),"""Oh, I want to be 5 foot six instead of 5 foot 4",
47,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),"or like reasons that aren't necessarily the most important.""",
48,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),I just think if it could genuinely help someone,
49,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),like if someone had cancer and there was a way to fix it or like slow down the growth.,
50,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, a lot of the work that we do in my lab is about being engineers of DNA.",
51,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),We try and look to see what mutations cause diseases,
52,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and to see if when we change those mutations,
53,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),if we can take a sick cell or organism and make it healthy again.,
54,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),Couldn't you technically cuz the p-53 when it's defected does,
55,Speaker 3 (Bella - Teenager),that's what causes cancer.,
56,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),P-53 is the most common mutation in cancer.,
57,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),That's that's right.,
58,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"Yeah, that's a great idea actually to use crisper to target tumor cells",
59,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and restore p-53 to fix that that mutation.,
60,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So to make that cut with these scissors and fix it.,
