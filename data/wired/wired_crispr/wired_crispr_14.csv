61,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Have you heard about crisper?,
62,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"Yes, this revolutionary gene editing tool.",
63,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"I know there have been uh previous gene editing tools,",
64,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),but crisper is more revolutionary in that it's more precise and a little bit more affordable.,
65,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Do you know how crisper works?,
66,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),So it works where you have this crisper this cast 9 complex,
67,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),and protein cast 9 protein cast 9 protein complex,
68,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),along with uh something called a guide RNA.,
69,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),That's right.,
70,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),That's right.,
71,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),And that RNA will basically tell this protein where to go,
72,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),and what gene to sort of cut out.,
73,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Right.,
74,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And this is what makes the crisper system very programmable,
75,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),is that the little piece of guide RNA is easy to make.,
76,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),We can program crisper to go to many different places in the genome quite easily.,
77,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"From what I've heard, they're like close to almost curing musculardrophe with it.",[musculardrophe = muscular dystrophy]
78,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"But there's a lot of, I guess, ethical issues that come up with it, too.",
79,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),One of the really nice things actually about crisper is that we can use it in human cells.,
80,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"You know, if you ask most people, should you use it to cure cancer?",
81,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"Mo most people would say, yeah, those those are are good good uses.",
82,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"But there are other areas that are a little bit more problematic,",
83,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"like editing the germ line, which means something that um could be passed on.",
84,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"Ethics wise, a lot of people will have that natural reaction of fear against something new,",
85,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),"cuz it has a lot of potential, and we just don't know where it can take us yet.",
86,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),It was sort of similar to like when people started doing in vitro fertilization.,
87,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Test tube babies.,
88,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),Test babies.,
89,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),That was the kind of scare.,
90,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Exactly.,
91,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Exactly.,
92,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),But now we see it's perfectly fine as long you know it's regulated,
93,Speaker 4 (Christopher - Student),and plenty of people I know some people who came up from that.,
