135,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So Matt, what are you doing right now in the lab and how are you using gene editing in your own work?",
136,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Right now, one of the questions I've been very much interested in is trying to understand",
137,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),the effect of human genetic variation on using crisper cast 9 reagents,
138,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),because you and I just sitting here differ in millions of different locations within our genome.,
139,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),We use these guide RNAs which are 20 base pairs and we match it to different places in the genome.,
140,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),But what if there's a mutation at that site and how does that affect a mutation that's different between you and me?,
141,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),It's the same site but there's a slight difference in the DNA between you and me.,
142,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Exactly.,
143,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Let's say in you it's a perfect match and in me there's one that's actually a mismatch,
144,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),and how does that affect things in the lab?,
145,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Because maybe it won't be as efficient.,
146,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),It won't be able to bring cast 9 to the correct site and cut there.,
147,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So when when people are using crisper now in the lab, are they really sequencing the exact cell type they use?",
148,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Sequencing reading out the genome of that cell before they use crisper.,
149,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Not many do that.,
150,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),It would ultimately the best way to do it for sure because the reference genome that was published in 2001,
151,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),was kind of just one person's genome.,
152,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"And as we know very well from sequencing many different individuals, there are a lot of differences.",
153,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And so there are some concerns that when you use these in the lab that you're intending for a cut to be made in this one place in the genome.,
154,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"But if there happens to be a mismatch there because of some variant in the cells that you're studying,",
155,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),maybe it won't cut there at all.,
156,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And even maybe worse is that maybe it'll cut somewhere else because maybe now it can match elsewhere.,
157,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So So you're saying right now that it's it's kind of early days with crisper,
158,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and that there's a lot of technical issues that really need to be ironed out,
159,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),that it's not anything can be targeted at any time.,
160,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),We're trying to develop the scientific steps that will take us to that kind of total genome control.,
161,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),It is still the early days and as much progress has been done which is actually quite remarkable given how new this technology is.,
162,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I mean we're just a few years away from when it was really started being used for these applications.,
163,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"However, having said that it holds a lot of potential and I think can get there,",
164,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),but there's still a lot of issues and concerns that need to be worked out.,
165,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I was going to say that a lot of what inspired me to get into um bioengineering are are movies like uh Jurassic Park um,
166,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),which both shows the good and the bad sides of manipulating the nature around us.,
167,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"And so maybe it's a bit of a silly question, but what do you think in our lifetime",
168,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),will we see something like Jurassic Park where where humans have actually engineered uh different different animals?,
169,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Anything is possible.,
170,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"U I'm not sure that we will see that in our lifetimes,",
171,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),but I would be very excited to attend Jurassic Park if that were the case.,
172,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Having said that, I do think that crisper cast 9 does have a lot of potential to do things that are kind of out of the box.",
173,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"In the past few years, we've been able to tackle ideas that people didn't even think were possible before that.",
174,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"More than anything, Crisper has created a whole open field of opportunities.",
175,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"And so whether or not that leads us to Jurassic Park, I can't tell you that answer for sure, but I certainly hope that it does.",
176,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And I think you're right that the opportunities might be much broader than just biomedical science.,
177,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"It might be things like using DNA as a hard drive, being able to uh use crisper as a diagnostic instead of just a tool for for editing.",
178,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Can we yeah use cells to record data over time with with crisper?,
179,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Can we use crisper to track cells in a developing embryo?,
180,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I think this is one of the most exciting recent uses of crisper.,
181,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I've seen that I would have never predicted uh a year ago.,
182,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),The dominant paradigm right now is crisper is just for cutting DNA.,
183,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"But when you think of it more as a general platform, a pointer to a location in a genome,",
184,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),then that becomes a very very powerful thing.,
185,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Do you think crisper will be helpful for understanding human v variation beyond what we already have just by sequencing people's genomes?,
186,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Yes, absolutely.",
187,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think that the real power of crisper lets us to follow up on this genetic information that we've been studying and following for a very long time now.,
188,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),There have been a lot of studies where you take a group of people with disease X and people without that disease,
189,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),and you see if any mutations seem to be preferentially in the group with the disease and kind of absent in the group without the disease.,
190,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),People have observed these differences.,
191,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),But what you're saying is with crisper we can now test is this causal this factor,
192,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),if we make this mutation does it cause the disease?,
193,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Does it either create cickle cell anemia or amilarate cickle cell anemia and pre and prevent it?,[cickle = sickle; amilarate = ameliorate]
194,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Do you think we we'll ever be at a place where based on looking at someone's genome and these kinds of crisper functional screens,
195,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),we can predict what kinds of diseases these people might get 10 20 years in the future.,
196,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think that's certainly a great goal.,
197,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"As of now, we tend to focus on variants or mutations that we know the function.",
198,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),What about mutations we've never seen before?,
199,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Something that comes from, let's say, UV radiation in melanoma or something.",
200,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think that we will ultimately have the power to do that.,
201,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"And so thinking about when you start from a mutation, do you look at the expression of RNA?",
202,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Is that changed? Is it changing things at the protein level?,
203,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, so this is interesting.",
204,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So you mentioned that we can analyze genomes the DNA level and then you said the RNA level looking at the expression of genes,
205,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and then the proteins the products that they actually make with proteomics or mass uh uh spectrometry,
206,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),but do you think it's kind of like another level of understanding the function of the genome or do you view it as part of one one of those those levels?,
207,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I do think it provides a different level of data.,
208,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),The ability to rapidly and genomewide assess and make changes at the DNA level,
209,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),and then look at the resulting changes at the RNA and protein level,
210,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think is something that we haven't been able to do and is now I think going to rapidly advance understanding at a genetic level,
211,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),at the DNA level of a lot of different diseases.,
212,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, so you and I have done functional screens.",
213,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"We've done these large scale crisper screens where we modify many genes, thousands of genes or thousands of locations in the genome",
214,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),all in kind of a test system.,
215,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),But do you ever see this one day the idea of these multipplex pulled crisper screens going into the clinic,
216,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),that we actually take a clinical cell line a cell line from a patient?,
217,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Absolutely. I think that is kind of one of the ultimate goals.,
218,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Ultimately, it would be very nice to be able to correct the mutations for these diseases we've known about for sometimes hundreds of years",
219,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),and we just haven't been able to do anything about.,
220,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),There's a lot of kind of ethical issues surrounding very reasonably using crisper in the clinic.,
221,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think there's a lot of concern about trying to use crisper technology or other genome technologies,
222,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"to make humans designed in a specific way whether you want to change eye color, height or things like that.",
223,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"The kind of irony of that situation is that the genetics of a lot of the traits that are, you know, you can see by just looking at a person",
224,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),are quite complex and are not worked out in the same way.,
225,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, so you're saying that the ethical problem is not really right now a clear and present issue",
226,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"because for many of these um perhaps a little bit more superficial traits that we have,",
227,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),we don't really even know what what genes can control these these traits.,
228,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),though it's probably a good idea to start thinking a little bit about engineering sematic cells,
229,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),versus um germline cells which are passed on to to future generations.,
230,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And I think one nice thing is that most scientists agree that for at least for human gene editing,
231,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),that we need to focus on sematic cells where which really impacts a lot of people with these diseases,
232,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and that there's many many issues around editing the germ line,
233,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),where there you're um doing something that might be inherited for for many many generations.,
234,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So it's it's kind of an interesting misconception that people think that crisper is just one thing,
235,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),just one enzyme cast 9.,
236,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think that's a really great point and that speaks to just how fast this technology is developing,
237,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),because it started with us just knowing about cast 9 but in just just one cast 9 right,
238,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),espiogyny's cast 9 was kind of the first one used for gene editing in in human cells.,[espiogyny = S. pyogenes]
239,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),Exactly.,
240,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And just in the past few years this this toolbox has now been expanded well past that.,
241,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"For example, you can look into other different species of bacteria to find cast 9.",
242,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, so cast 9 is over many different species.",
243,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),It's over a tremendous amount of bacteria.,
244,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And so you had referenced strep hygen cast 9.,
245,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Well, if they you look into staflacus orius, you can also find cast 9.",[staflacus orius = S. aureus]
246,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And that cast 9 is just slightly different.,
247,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),It can target different regions of the genome.,
248,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),And so that opens up a whole new set of possibilities in terms of genome editing.,
249,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So it increases the targetable space within the human genome.,
250,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),you can target more regions that you couldn't with that first first cast 9,
251,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and and what I find actually is a really interesting thing,
252,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),is that there's this huge metagenomic diversity of different crisper systems,
253,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and most of them are really just not even well characterized yet,
254,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and I think the best example of that we were talking about it earlier is this new RNA targeting crisper,
255,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),so instead of cutting DNA it targets RNA,
256,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and I think this is just one example of a complete paradigm shift,
257,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I don't think anyone had necessarily predicted at beginning that this would be one of the things,
258,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),that just was created and existed in nature and it just took some time for people to uncover it.,
259,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),I think it's a great good example of why it's important actually to fund basic science,
260,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"because you sometimes when you start down a certain path, you never know where you're going to end up in the end.",
261,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),The more research that can be done in this area can really unleash new possibilities.,
262,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),"Finding new things, different versions of cast 9 or other things that function like cast 9",
263,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),or things completely different that at this moment I can't even think of.,
264,Speaker 6 (Matthew Canver),The possibilities are endless to be a little cliche about it.,
265,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"No, literally I think they are endless for sure.",
266,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I think it's great for people of all ages to understand crisper and at least a little bit about genome engineering,
267,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),because so much of the world today revolves around biology.,
268,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"Also, there's something about self-standing.",[self-standing = self-understanding]
269,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),We really want to understand ourselves and what makes up ourselves.,
270,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And crisper and gene editing is another way to get at what is the substance um underlying,
