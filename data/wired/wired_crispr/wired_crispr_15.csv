94,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So there's been a lot of talk about using crisper for gene editing in humans,
95,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),and that that can be a controversial thing,
96,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I think very naturally there's many aspects of ethics that need to be looked at.,
97,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),"Firstly, if we're talking about using crisper, are we using it in sematic cells such as TE-C cells",[sematic = somatic; TE-C = T cells]
98,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),or are we using it in embryos or germ stem cells?,
99,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),And the issue with that is now you're modifying the genome at a germline level.,
100,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Any unintended consequences could go forward many generations.,
101,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"You're saying with germline editing, sure, there's unintended consequences,",
102,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),but there's also lack of consent.,
103,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"If you are not around, you can't consent.",
104,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Exactly.,
105,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),So these future generations or products of crisper they can't consent.,
106,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Another I think ethical component is if crisper does make it to market who will have access to it.,
107,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Is that going to be cost prohibitive?,
108,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Will only a certain select few be able to use it?,
109,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"As many new cancer drugs are today, right?",
110,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),Will that be how it is?,
111,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Yeah.,
112,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Would people start using it for non-therapeutic reasons?,
113,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),And I think this then can get into a whole slippery slope.,
114,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So, I think a lot of people are concerned maybe that crisper will be used in kind of frivolous ways,",
115,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),maybe just to choose somebody's eye color or or how tall they are or what color hair they have.,
116,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),And I think what a lot of people don't realize maybe is that the state of genetics is not quite there.,
117,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"It's nice to think that I can go in and choose exactly what eye color I want,",
118,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),but fundamentally science doesn't exactly know all of that yet.,
119,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),We don't know every single gene related to eye color nor the regulatory mechanisms nor the epigenetics.,
120,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),This is a huge,
121,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),So we can use crisper now to try and understand better how do our genes relate to these these different features,
122,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),these different phenotypes that that we have.,
123,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),There's a lot of work left to do before we even know what I think what are the knobs and dials,
124,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),what are the controls that you know affect eye color or how tall you are.,
125,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),"So I think this question right now, even though it's important to discuss,",
126,Speaker 1 (Neville Sanjana),I kind of feel like it's more theoretical right now.,
127,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Yeah.,
128,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Or is it really even a point necessary for conversation?,
129,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),Because people are going out every single day and getting plastic surgery to change how they look.,
130,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),How is this any different?,
131,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),"And in the same slant, people are using in vitro fertilization, right?",
132,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),So this is manipulating genomes.,
133,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),You're choosing which embryos to implant.,
134,Speaker 5 (Lauren Schiff),So we're almost doing little aspects of what crisper has the potential to do.,
