Um, so circadian rhythms—I think that’s like, your body’s natural clock? It’s the thing that tells you when to sleep and wake up, right? Like, it runs on a 24-hour cycle, kind of like the sun. So your body expects certain things to happen at certain times. Sleep at night, wake up in the morning, that kind of stuff. I’ve heard that light plays a big role? Like, if you stare at your phone too late, it messes with your rhythm and makes it harder to fall asleep. Or if you fly to a different time zone, you feel off—that’s jet lag, I think. I didn’t know it affected stuff like hormones or digestion, but apparently it does. Like, when you eat or take medicine might matter too? It’s kinda wild that our bodies keep time on their own. I just thought it was about being tired or not, but there’s a whole system behind it. I guess that’s why people say to keep a routine—it’s not just habits, it’s biology.
